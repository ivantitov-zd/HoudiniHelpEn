= Resample =

"""Resamples an input's channels to a new rate and/or start/end
interval."""

This CHOP resamples an input's channels to a new rate and/or start/end
interval. In all cases, the entire input interval is resampled to match
the output interval.


@parameters

== Resample ==

    Method:
        The resample method to apply to the channels.

        Same Rate, New Interval:
            Stretches or compresses the channels like the Stretch CHOP.
        New Rate, Same Time Range:
            Changes the sample rate without changing the time-length of
            the CHOP.
        New Rate, Same Index Range:
            Changes the sample rate without changing the number of
            samples in the CHOP.
        New Rate, New Interval:
            Changes both the sample rate and stretches/compresses the
            CHOP.
    Sample Rate:
        The new sample rate.
    Unit Values:
        Determines how the __Start/End__ parameters are interpreted.

        Absolute:
            The value is the new start/end position.
        Relative to Start/End:
            The value is a shift from the old start/end position.
    Start:
        #channels: /start

        The CHOP's new start position.
    End:
        #channels: /end

        The CHOP's new end position.
    Interpolation:
        The interpolation method to use when resampling.

        No Interpolation:
            Use the value of the nearest sample.
        Linear:
            Use linear interpolation between samples when the output has
            more samples. Averages all samples near the new sample when
            the output has fewer samples.
        Cubic:
            Cubically interpolates between samples, for smoother curves
            than Linear. This method is not recommended for channels
            with sharp changes.
        Pulse Preserve:
            A linear interpolation that recognizes single sample pulses
            and preserves their height and one sample width. A pulse is
            a non-zero value preceded and followed by zero-value
            samples.
    Constant Area:
        If on, keeps the area under the channel constant by scaling the
        the values of the channel.
    Correct For Cycles:
        If on, compensate for cyclic channels (such as angles) by always
        choosing the shortest step between samples, like 360 to 0 for
        angles.
    Cycle Length:
        #channels: /cyclelen

        The length of the cycle. 360 for angles.
