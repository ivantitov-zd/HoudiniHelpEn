"""Adds an audio-style attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) envelope to all trigger points in the input channels."""

This CHOP adds an audio-style attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) envelope to all trigger points in the input channels. A trigger point occurs whenever the first input's channel increases across the trigger threshold value.

The envelope consists of six major sections: delay, attack, peak, decay, sustain and release.

From the time the threshold is reached and while the channel's value is above the release threshold, the envelope is in its sustain phase during which it will delay, attack, peak-hold, decay and then maintain its sustain value. Then the envelope will decay to `0`.

The peak and sustain levels can be set independently, but peak can never be less than sustain.

Without an input connected, a single full envelope is generated.


@parameters

    == Trigger ==

        Release = Trigger Threshold:
            If on, the trigger and release thresholds are the same
            value.
        Trigger Threshold:
            #channels: /threshup

            The trigger threshold (see above)
        Release Threshold:
            #channels: /threshdown

            The release threshold (see above)
        Re-trigger Delay:
            #channels: /retrigger

            The amount of time after a trigger point that a new trigger
            may occur.
        Min Trigger Length:
            #channels: /mintrigger

            The minimum amount of time that the trigger will remain
            active.
        Trigger On:
            Determines whether a trigger occurs on an increasing slope
            or decreasing slope when passing the trigger threshold. A
            release will occur on the opposite slope.

    == Attack ==

        Delay Length:
            The amount of time to delay the envelope after the trigger
            point.
        Attack Length:
            #channels: /attack

            The amount of rise time from zero to the peak level.
        Attack Shape:
            The shape of the attack ramp.
        Peak Level:
            #channels: /peak

            The peak level.
        Peak Length:
            #channels: /peaklen

            The length of time of the peak.

    == Sustain ==

        Decay Length:
            #channels: /decay

            The amount of decay time from the peak level to the sustain
            level.
        Decay Shape:
            The shape of the decay ramp.
        Sustain Level:
            #channels: /sustain

            The sustain level. This level is held until a release point
            is reached.
        Release Length:
            #channels: /release

            The amount of release time from the sustain level to zero.
        Release Shape:
            The shape of the release ramp.

    == Chan ==

        Channel Name:
            Channel name when no inputs connected.
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            Sample rate when no inputs connected.
        Complete Envelope:
            If on, a complete envelope is produced for each trigger
            point. If off, the envelope may be terminated at any time by
            a release point.
        Remainder:
            What to do with remaining samples at end of the interval.

            Discard Remainder:
                Output interval = input interval.
            Make Output Longer:
                Output longer if envelope unfinished.
            Mix Remainder to Beginning:
                Add remainder to samples at the start.
