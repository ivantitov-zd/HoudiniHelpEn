Houdini provides a wide variety of geometry nodes for generating and shaping terrain.

These tools represent terrain using 2D volumes where each voxel contains the height of the terrain at that grid point, called _height fields_. The data passing through a geometry network can contain multiple height fields. In the terminology of Houdini's terrain tools, these are called _height layers_. For example, a tool might use one height layer to represent bedrock and another to represent loose soil on top. The default height layer is named `height`.

The tools also use a different type of 2D volume, where each voxel contains a "selected-ness" value, called a _mask layer_. Most terrain nodes take a second input that can contain a mask layer to control which parts of the terrain the node will modify. The default mask layer is named `mask`. Like height layers, it's possible to have multiple mask layers in a geometry stream, and specify which named mask layer to use in a node's parameters.

The Houdini viewport knows how to visualize the 2D `height` field as a 3D surface, and the `mask` field as a red tint on the 3D surface.

== Masterclass ==

:vimeo_ref: Houdini 16 Masterclass: Height fields
    #id: 234755478


== Generating a height field from scratch ==

* The [Height Field node|Node:sop/heightfield] generates a new, flat height field.

    A Height Field node followed by a [Height Field Noise|Node:sop/heightfield_noise] is the primary way to start with some random terrain.


== I/O ==

* [Node:sop/heightfield_file] loads height data from a 2D elevation map.

* [Node:sop/lidarimport] can load LIDAR formats (for example e57) as height fields.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_output] writes height data to a 2D elevation map.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_quickshade] adds materials to terrain based on layers and masks, for rendering.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_scatter] scatters points across the 3D surface represented by a height field. This is useful for distributing 3D geometry such as trees/plants across the terrain, or converting the height volume into a point cloud.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_tilesplit] splits a layer into multiple tiles. This can be useful for distributing work, for working on smaller pieces at a time, or for exporting tiles to game engines.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_tilesplice] combines tiles into a single layer.


== Adding features to terrain ==

* [Node:sop/heightfield_layer] composites one height layer over another, allowing you to "paste" a feature into a larger field. The node will properly composite volumes that aren't axis aligned, so you can position and rotate the volumes in 3D space before compositing.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_project] raises or lowers terrain in the shape of 3D geometry.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_paint] lets you paint elevation values into a height layer by hand.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_pattern] generates repeating patterns such as stripes. It includes distortion controls which can make the geometric patterns look more organic. Adding these patterns into a height layer with a mask can create interesting details in terrain.


== Conditioning terrain ==

* [Node:sop/heightfield_blur] smooths out details in terrain.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_noise] and [Node:sop/heightfield_distort] add random detail to terrain.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_clip] flattens areas above and/or below a certain height, for example to create tableland (mesa/tapui).

* [Node:sop/heightfield_terrace] creates flattened steps up slopes, creating looks like terraced farms or waterfall rock formations.


== Simulating natural processes ==

* [Node:sop/heightfield_erode] simulates the process of erosion, creating natural-looking features.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_slump] simulates the process of loose/piled soil moving downhill.


== Making and editing masks ==

* [Node:sop/heightfield_drawmask] lets you draw masked areas by hand.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_maskbyfeature] creates masks based on criteria such as elevation, facing direction, or slope. For example, you can create a mask layer representing snowfall only above a certain elevation and only on a certain side of a mountain.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_maskbyobject] creates a mask from the intersection of a height layer and some 3D geometry.

* Height Field Mask Noise creates a customized [Height Field Noise|Node:sop/heightfield_noise] set up to add noise to a mask layer, which can make it look more organic.

* Height Field Mask Clear creates a customized [Height Field Layer Clear|Node:sop/heightfield_layerclear] set up to clear the mask.


== Layer utilities ==

* [Node:sop/heightfield_xform] moves and rotates the fields in world space.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_visualize] lets you visualize elevation values using a color ramp.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_remap] "redistributes" height values in a layer into a new range, based on a ramp.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_resample] changes the resolution of a field's underlying grid.

* Height Field Wrangle is an alias for [Volume Wrangle|Node:sop/volumewrangle]. It lets you edit the values in a height volume using a [VEX snippet|/vex/snippets].

* Height Field VOP is an alias for [Volume VOP|Node:sop/volumevop] lets you build a VOP network to edit the values in a height volume.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_copylayer] creates a new layer by copying an existing one.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_layerproperty] sets layer options such as how to compute values outside boundaries of the field (__Border type__).

* [Node:sop/heightfield_layerclear] resets the values in a layer to 0.

* [Node:sop/heightfield_isolatelayer]


== Tips and notes ==

* The Terrain [desktop|/basics/panes] has a specialized shelf set, [radial menu|/basics/radialmenus], and pane layout for working with terrain.

* You can take advantage of the ((Tab)) menu's smart completion to type `height` or just `hf` instead of the full `height field` when searching for height field nodes. For example, you can type `hfnoise` to get the [Height Field Noise node|Node:sop/heightfield_noise].

* Because height fields and masks are regular Houdini volume geometry, you can use any geometry (SOP) node that works with volumes to edit height fields and masks. For example, you can flood fill the mask to be fully "on" everywhere using a [Volume Wrangle|Node:sop/volumewrangle] with the VEX snippet `@mask = 1;`.
