= Ray =

"""Projects one surface onto another."""

The Ray operator projects rays from each point of the first input
geometry in the direction of its normal, and then moves the point to any
geometry the ray hits from the second input.

You can use this node to drape clothes over surfaces, shrink-wrap one
object with another, and other similar effects.

== Example ==

steps>>
    # Place a Grid node, set its __Orientation__ to "XY Plane", and
      translate it in Z by 2.5. Turn its template flag on.

    # Append a Point node to the Grid and change __Keep Normal__ to __Add Normal__ on the standard tab of the parameter editor.

    # Place a Sphere node, set its geometry type to NURBS, set its
      radius to 2,2,2, and translate it in Z by -2.5 .

    # Turn on the display of [Icon:VIEW/display_point_normals] point normals in the viewer's right side toolbar.

    # Append a Ray node to the Point node and connect the Sphere to
      the right input. Turn on its display flag.

    # Turn the __Intersect farthest surface__ checkbox on to move
      the projected plane onto the "back" of the sphere.

The Ray op will move the points of the Grid in the direction of the
point normals. The first surface of the Collision Source (right
input) will be where those points of the grid will rest. You can
make those points rest on the other side of the sphere by enabling
the Intersect Farthest Surface option. This means that the points
should continue to project to the farthest surface of the collision
source.

@parameters
    Group:
        Group of primitives or points to project.
    Entity:
        Project points or primitives.
    Collision Group:
        Group of primitives to project on.
    Method:

        Project Rays:
            Points are projected along their normals until intersecting
            with collision geometry.
        Minimum Distance:
            Points are placed on the closest point on the collision
            geometry. This method does not use point normals. Use it to
            shrinkwrap or project one primitive onto another.
    Direction from:
	How to determine the direction to send rays.

	Vector:
	    A ray direction vector is explicitly provided.
	Normal:
	    Normals are computed, if necessary, on the input and used
	    as the ray direction.
	Attribute:
	    A given attribute is used. It should be a 3-float vector
	    attribute giving the direction to send the rays in.
    Ray Direction:
	Direction to project rays from each point.
    Direction Attribute:
	The point attribute to use to determine ray direction.
    Show Guide Geometry:
	Controls if the geometry being instanced onto is drawn.  Does
	not affect the behavior, only the viewport.
    Transform Points:
        Move the intersected geometry.
    Intersect Farthest Surface:
        Ray source is projected to farthest collision surface instead of
        the closest.
    Point Intersection Normal:
        Ray point normals gets value of collision normals at points of
        intersection. These are the surface normals and not interpolated
        point normals. If you want the interpolated point normals, you
        will need to turn on __Get Point Attributes__ and specify the N
        attribute. In that case, this option will have no effect.
    Point Intersection Distance:
        Ray point dist attribute gets value of distance to collision
        source.
    Reverse Rays:
        Set this to make rays fire in the direction opposite to the
        normals.
    
    Ray Tolerance:
        Controls the tolerance of the ray intersection. Due to numerical round off, otherwise watertight geometry might let rays pass through it.  The ray tolerance decreases the chance of ray leakage by allowing near misses to count as hits. For very small geometry, you may want to decrease the default to avoid false positives.  Likewise, very large geometry may need a higher value.
    
    Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        When transforming points scale the intersection path.
    Lift:
        #channels: /lift

        Offset surface in normal direction after the points have been
        transformed to their new locations.
    Bias:
        #channels: /bias

        The minimum distance along the normal from the original position
        of the point where the rays will look for intersections. This
        allows you to offset the starting position of the rays.
    Max Distance:
        #channels: /maxraydist

        The maximum distance from the original position of the point the
        rays will look at. No ray intersections outside this range will
        be detected.  If __Method__ is __Minimum Distance__, any points
        farther from the surface than this will not be moved.
    Sample:
        #channels: /sample

        Number of rays sent per point. If greater than 1, rays are
        randomly perturbed and combined using the method specified in
        __Ray Combiner__.
    Jitter Scale:
        #channels: /jitter

        Controls perturbation of extra rays.
    Ray Combiner:
        This option lets you specify how information from extra rays is
        used.

        Average ray:
            The fired rays that hit the second input's geometry are
            averaged. The point is then moved along its normal direction
            by the average distance. If you turned on __Point
            Intersection Normal__, the resulting normal is also the
            average from all the fired rays.
        Median ray:
            The median length ray that hits the second input's geometry
            is found. The point is then moved along its normal direction
            by the median ray's length. If you turned on __Point
            Intersection Normal__, the resulting normal is taken from
            the median ray.
        Shortest ray:
            The shortest ray that hits the second input's geometry is
            found. The point is then moved along its normal direction by
            this ray's length. If you turned on __Point Intersection
            Normal__, the resulting normal is taken from the shortest
            ray.
        Longest ray:
            The Longest ray that hits the second input's geometry is
            found. The point is then moved along its normal direction by
            this ray's length. If you turned on __Point Intersection
            Normal__, the resulting normal is taken from the longest
            ray.
    Seed:
        #channels: /seed

        Seeds the random number generator.
    Create Point Group:
        Point group of all successful intersections.
    Ray Hit Group:
        Name of the point group.
    Prim Num Attribute:
        #id: primnumattrib

        When enabled, an attribute will be output indicating the number of the primitive hit by each point.  Enable this and __Prim UVW Attribute__ for use with
        [Attribute Interpolate|Node:sop/attribinterpolate], to have the points stick on deforming geometry.
    Prim UVW Attribute:
        #id: primuvwattrib

        When enabled, an attribute will be output indicating the coordinates where each point hit, in the parameter space of the primitive each point hit.
        Enable this and __Prim Num Attribute__ for use with [Attribute Interpolate|Node:sop/attribinterpolate], to have the points stick on deforming geometry.
    Get Point Attributes:
        This allows you to extract point attributes from the hit
        surface. The extracted attribute will take on an interpolated
        value according to where the surface is hit. This option works
        with the __Ray Combiner__ option: the attribute value will
        either come from the average attribute value from all the hits
        or the value associated with the median length, shortest or
        longest ray. The interpolated attribute values are not
        normalized.
    Point Attributes:
        Specify the point attributes from the second input that you want
        to extract. If the attributes you specify do not exist in the
        first input, they will be created. If the attributes you specify
        have the same name but a different size or type in the first
        input, they will be overwritten. If you specify the normal
        attribute here (N), the __Point Intersection Normal__ option
        will have no effect and the final normal set to each point will
        be computed by interpolating the point normal from the target
        surface.
@inputs
    Ray points or primitives:
        The geometry to project onto the geometry in the second input.
        This geometry must have point normal attributes (use the [Point
        operator|Node:sop/point] to add them).
    Collision primitives:
        The geometry on which to project.
