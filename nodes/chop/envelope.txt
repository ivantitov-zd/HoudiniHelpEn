"""Outputs the maximum amplitude in the vicinity of each sample of the input."""

The Envelope CHOP outputs the maximum amplitude in the vicinity of each sample of the input. It takes the absolute value of the input, and uses a sliding window of a number of samples to find the maximum amplitude near each sample.


TIP:
    The loudness levels of an audio track can be kept roughly constant by computing an envelope of the audio with a wide window, and then passing the original audio and the envelope to a [Math CHOP|Node:chop/math] and selecting Combine CHOP > Divide. This will make the amplitude
    approximately 1.

    Type:
        The two methods of calculating the envelope:

        Exponential Decay:
            For each sample, the value is compared to the previous
            sample. If it is greater than the previous, the value of the
            envelope is equal to the value of that sample, and that
            sample is stored as the current peak. If it is less than,
            the value of the envelope decays exponentially from the last
            peak to the current value (as more samples pass that are
            smaller than the peak, the envelope decays toward the
            waveform). 

	    Pros of this method: envelope always encloses the
            data. Cons: slope can be discontinuous, making the output
            look bumpy.
        Local Maximum Window:
            The channel is separated into windows of N samples
            determined by the __Envelope Width__. In each window, the
            maximum amplitude is found. The maximum value of the window
            is used as the envelope value. 

	    Pros of this method: Good
            shape. Cons: signal sometimes jumps outside the envelope.
            The signal is quantized, so pulses can be off by as much as
            N/2.
    Envelope Bounds:
        Determines which values are used to compute the envelope:
        magnitude, power, maximum or minimum values.
    Envelope Width:
        #channels: /width

        The width of the window to use in the envelope calculation.
        Adjust this width to capture as many features of the input as
        needed. Lower values capture more detail, while higher values
        create a smoother envelope. It is expressed in Units.
    Interpolate:
        In Local Maximum window mode, this provides interpolation
        options for the windowed values.
    Normalize Power Envelope:
        Keeps the total power in the signal constant when adjusting the
        __Envelope Width__.
    Resample Envelope:
        If on, the envelope is resampled down to the rate listed in the
        next parameter. This is very useful for audio.
    Sample Rate:
        #channels: /samplerate

        The sample rate used to resample the envelope after it is
        calculated.
