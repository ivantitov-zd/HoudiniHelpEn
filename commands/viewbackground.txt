"""Sets general options for the viewport background."""

:usage: `viewbackground [<<@options] <<viewports/view-memories>> `

You can paste an image in the background of a viewport for rotoscoping
or reference purposes. This command sets the general options for the display of
the background image. To set the actual image and its position, 
use [viewroto|/commands/viewroto].

Without any options, the command prints the current values for the
viewport/view-memory you specify.

See [how to refer to viewers and viewports|/commands/_guide#viewers] .

    `-i on|off`:
        Background texture filtering on/off. When off, individual pixels 
        appear as blocks at high zoom levels, otherwise they are interpolated.
    `-m <<u>> <<v>> `:
