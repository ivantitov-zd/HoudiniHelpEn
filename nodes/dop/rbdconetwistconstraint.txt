= Cone Twist Constraint =

"""Constrains an object to remain a certain distance from the constraint, and limits the object's rotation."""

This involves constraining some location on the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to a goal location derived from another simulation object or from a position in world space.

RBD Cone Twist Constraint is a digital asset.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters

== Constraint ==

Constrained Object:
    #channels: /group

    Identifies the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to be constrained.
Goal Object:
    #channels: /goalgroup

    Identifies an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] used to determine the goal
    position. If this parameter is left blank, the objects will be constrained to a world space position.
Constrained Location:
    #channels: /objectposx /objectposy /objectposz

    Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
    local object space position of the constraint.
Goal Location:
    #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

    Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
    local object space position of the constraint in the goal
    object.

== Cone Twist ==

Max Up Rotation:
    The maximum rotation up or down in degrees.
Max Out Rotation:
    The maximum rotation from side to side in degrees.
Max Twist:
    The maximum twist in degrees.
Softness:
    Once an angle is greater than softness * the maximum
    angle, the constraint begins to take effect. Lowering
    the value of softness softens the constraint boundaries.

Constraint Force Mixing:
    Increase this to make the constraint spongier, and potentially
    increase the stability of the simulation. The constraint may be
    violated by an amount proportional to the force required to
    re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
Bias Factor:
    The rate at which the constraint corrects errors in
    position. A value of 1 will ensure that the constraint
    is always obeyed. It is recommended to keep bias between
    0.2 and 0.5.
Relaxation Factor:
    The rate at which the angular velocity is changed by the
    constraint. A low value means the constraint will modify
    the velocities slowly, leaving the boundaries appearing
    softer.

Goal Twist Axis:
    The goal direction of the cone.  Defaults to the X axis.
Goal Up Axis:
    The goal direction of the up axis. Defaults to the Y axis.
    This should be perpendicular to the twist axis. The out
    axis is calculated as the cross product of the twist
    and up axes.
Goal Twist Offset:
    This parameter rotates the __Goal Up Axis__ around the __Goal Twist
    Axis__. Specified in degrees.
Constrained Twist Axis:
    The initial twist axis of the constrained object.
Constrained Up Axis:
    The initial up axis of the constrained object. This should be
    perpendicular to the constrained twist axis.
Constrained Twist Offset:
    This parameter rotates the __Constrained Up Axis__ around the __Constrained Twist
    Axis__. Specified in degrees.
