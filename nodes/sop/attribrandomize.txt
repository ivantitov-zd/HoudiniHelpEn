"""Generates random attribute values of various distributions."""

== Overview ==

This node generates random values to create or modify an attribute.

Turn on the __Visualize as Points__ toggle to preview the probability distribution as a generated point cloud whose positions are drawn from the distribution.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The subset of geometry whose attribute should be modified.

    This can be a point, vertex, primitive, or edge group.  If necessary, it will be expanded to a point, vertex, or primitive group, depending on the value of __Attribute Class__.
    If the input geometry doesn't have the specified attribute, geometry elements outside the group will get the value zero.

Group Type:
    #id: grouptype

    The type of group that __Group__ specifies.

    If __Guess from Group__ is specified and the group type is ambiguous, the guess is made that __Group__ specifies a point group.

Attribute Class:
    #id: class

    The type of elements for which to create or modify the attribute specified by, __Attribute Name__.

Attribute Name:
    #id: name

    The name of the attribute to create or modify.

    It will be added to the type of elements specified by __Attribute Class__.

Operation:
    #id: operation

    Specifies how to modify existing attribute values.  If the attribute doesn't already exist, this should be __Set Value__.

    __Set Value__ means that the generated value will be written over the existing attribute value.
    __Add Value__ means that the generated value will be added to the existing attribute value.
    __Minimum__/__Maximum__ means that the final attribute value will be the minimum/maximum of the generated value and the existing attribute value.
    __Multiply__ means that the existing attribute value will be multiplied by the generated value.

Global Scale:
    #id: scale

    Scales the generated value just before applying the operation specified by __Operation__.

== Distribution ==

Distribution:
    #id: distribution

    Overall type of probability distribution from which values are generated.

    Constant Value:
        The generated values will all be the specified value, instead of being random.
    Two Values:
        The generated values will either be __Value A__ or __Value B__, depending on __Probability of Value B__.
    Uniform (Continuous):
        The generated values will be between __Min Value__ and __Max Value__, with equal probability for all values in that range.
    Uniform (Discrete):
        The generated values will be between __Min Value__ and __Max Value__ (inclusive), landing only on values that are some
        multiple of __Step Size__ greater than __Min Value__.

    Direction or Orientation:
        The generated values will be unit vectors (i.e. length 1) with the specified number of __Dimensions__.
        The samples will be uniform random unit vectors, within any __Cone Angle__ of __Direction__, unless __Bias Toward Direction__ is used.

        NOTE:
                For 4 __Dimensions__ that __Cone Angle__ is the maximum quaternion rotation angle away from __Direction__, which is twice the Euclidean cone angle of the unit 4D hypersphere being sampled.

    Inside Sphere:
        The generated values will be vectors with length less than 1, i.e. inside the unit sphere, with the specified number of __Dimensions__.
        The samples will be uniform random unit vectors, within any __Cone Angle__ of __Direction__, unless __Bias Toward Direction__ is used.

        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/attribrandomize/sphere_cone.jpg]

    Normal (Gaussian):
        The generated values will be drawn from the normal distribution whose mean/median is given by __Middle Value__,
        and whose standard deviation is given by __Scale Around Middle__.

        In multiple __Dimensions__, this distribution is naturally isotropic, i.e. rotationally symmetrical.

        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/attribrandomize/normal_distrib.jpg]

    Exponential:
        The generated values will be drawn from the exponential distribution whose median is given by __Middle Value__.
        The mean and the standard deviation are equal to the median divided by `ln(2)`.

        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/attribrandomize/exponential_distrib.jpg]

    Log-Normal:
        The generated values will be drawn from the log-normal distribution whose median is given by __Middle Value__, and whose standard deviation is given by __Spread Around Middle__.  This distribution is useful for generating random scales, because its values are strictly positive, and it tapers off toward zero, helping avoid
        scales that are too small or negative.

        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/attribrandomize/lognormal_distrib.jpg]

        The parameter μ, of the underlying normal distribution is `ln(median)`.
        The parameter σ, of the underlying normal distribution is
        `sqrt(log(0.5*(1 + sqrt(1 + 4*(stddev*stddev)/(median*median)))))`.

    Cauchy-Lorentz:
        The generated values will be drawn from the Cauchy distribution whose median is given by __Middle Value__, and whose scale parameter, γ, is given by __Scale Around Middle__.  This distribution has larger tails than the normal distribution, so it has more outliers, meaning that __Min Value__ and __Max Value__ will probably be useful for preventing problematic outliers.

        With __Dimensions__ greater than 1, this samples the multi-variate Cauchy distribution, forcing the distribution to be isotropic, i.e. rotationally symmetrical.  For 2 __Dimensions__, this is the distribution of photons hitting a plane from a point light at `(0,0,scale)`.

    Custom Ramp:
        The custom ramp will be sampled as the inverse cumulative distribution function (inverse CDF) of a probability distribution, and then scaled by __Fit Value 1 To__ minus __Fit Value 0 To__, and added to __Fit Value 0 To__.

    Custom Discrete:
        The specified values will be sampled with the specified weights, i.e. unnormalized probabilities.

        Type:
            Specifies whether to randomly sample from a list of __Float__ or __String__ values.

== Options ==

Visualize as Points:
    #id: visualize

    When enabled, the specified number of points are generated whose positions are sampled from the specified distribution, instead of modifying input geometry.
    No input is needed when this is enabled.

Visualize as Points:
    #id: nvisualizepts

    When enabled, the specified number of points are generated whose positions are sampled from the specified distribution, instead of modifying input geometry.
    No input is needed when this is enabled.

Fraction Attribute:
    #id: fractionattrib

    This gives a way of non-randomly sampling the distribution, by specifying locations in the uniform parametric space of the distribution, known as "quantiles".

    For example, if the fraction attribute is 0.61 for some element, and the distribution is continuous and 1-dimensional, the resulting value should be greater than exactly 61% of samples, if one were to sample the distribution an infinite number of times.
    For multi-dimensional distributions, the fraction attribute should have as many components as are needed to represent the distribution.
    For example, when sampling directions in 3D, it should have size 2, corresponding (non-linearly) with longitude and latitude.

Global Seed:
    #id: seed

    All generated values depend (psuedo)randomly on this value.  No two Attribute Randomize nodes in a scene should have the same value here, unless required, because the same or similar values may be generated if two are the same.  Choose a different value if the current seed produces samples that are from the right distribution, but happen to be undesirable samples.

    This is not applicable when __Fraction Attribute__ is enabled.

Seed Attribute:
    #id: seedattrib

    When disabled, the element number is used as a random seed for each element, in addition to the __Global Seed__ parameter.
    When enabled, the specified attribute is used instead, which allows for consistent generation when deleting geometry, if using a consistent ID.
    It also allows changing of seeds for just a subset of the elements, when only some samples are undesirable.

    This is not applicable when __Fraction Attribute__ is enabled.
