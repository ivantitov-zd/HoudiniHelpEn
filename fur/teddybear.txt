To create fur, start with a piece of geometry and use the [Add Fur|/shelf/groom_addfur] tool on the __Hair Utils__ shelf. By default, two nodes are created: [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] and [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen].

The red curves in the viewport represent guide hairs that you can style. You can use the tools on the __Guide Process__ tab to style the fur. Typically the first thing you'll want to do is set the direction of the fur by using the [Initialize Guides|/shelf/sop_groom_guideinit] tool. You can then use the __Wind Direction__ parameter to set the direction of the fur and the __Lift__ slider to create an initial look.

Next you can use the [Set Length|/shelf/sop_groom_guideprocess_length] tool to lengthen or shorten the hairs. Turning on the __Randomize__ checkbox will give the fur more varied length, creating a more natural look.

You can also create bends in the straight fur by using the [Bend|/shelf/sop_groom_guideprocess_bend] tool on the __Guide Groom__ shelf. This allows you to determine where the hair will curve using the __Curve Mask Ramp__ (for example just at the tip of the strand) as well as the __Angle__ at which it will bend.

Once you're finished styling the fur you can turn off the display flag on the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] object. The [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen] object takes the guide curves and generates hair from them.

TIP:
    You will need to render the [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen] node, not the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] node. However, the [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen] node pulls its data from the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] node, so you will need to turn the display back on before rendering.

There is checkbox called __Limit to bounding box__ on the [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen] object that allows you to focus on a patch of fur instead of having to wait for the entire surface area of the fur to cook as changes are made.

You can the change things like the __Thickness__ and __Density__ until you get the look you want.

TIP:
    If you can't see the generated hair properly, turn on [Icon:VIEW/lighting_high]__High Quality Lighting__ form the Display options toolbar on the right side of the viewport. Also click ((RMB)) and make sure __Ambient Occlusion__ is enabled.

You can also dive inside the [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen] object and click the [Clump tool|/shelf/sop_groom_hairclump] on the __Guide Process__ tab to add clumping to the fur. You can adjust the __Clump Size__ and __Iterations__ on the __Fractal Clumping__ tab to make the look of the clumping more natural for your model. Turning on __Curling__ will also give your fur a more natural look. By default the __Amplitude__ is set to `0` so you don't see any changes initially.
