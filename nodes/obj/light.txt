= Light template =

"""A very limited light object without any built-in render properties. Use this only if you want to build completely custom light with your choice of properties."""

The normal [Light node|Node:obj/hlight] starts with a large number of commonly used [render properties|/props]. If you want to build a completely customized light with only your choice of render properties, you can use this node as a starting point instead of stripping down the regular light node.

If you just want a standard light object, use the normal [Light node|Node:obj/hlight] instead.
