This is an advanced example of how to use the FindShortestPath SOP to prefer "central" paths, based on centraily measures computed using FindShortestPath and AttribWrangle.  This helps avoid staying too close to walls where avoidable.

Turn on the Display Option > Optimization > Culling > Remove Backfaces to see inside the space more easily.  Try visualizing the different centrality measures using the switch node.  The same example without considering the centrality of the path is demonstrated in a side branch of the SOP network, in order to see the difference.
