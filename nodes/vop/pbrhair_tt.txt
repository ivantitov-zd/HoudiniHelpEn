"""Produce a hair BSDF."""

This node will produce a BSDF for rendering the transmission component of hair. Typically, this node should be combined with [primary|/nodes/vop/pbrhair_r] and [secondary|/nodes/vop/pbrhair_trt] reflection components.

The [Hair Model VOP|Node:vop/hairmodel] combines all three BSDFs to get the overall hair effect.

@parameters

Component Label:
    #id: label
    #contentfrom: pbrspecular#label

Transmission Color:
    #id: tt_clr

    The transmission of the color components (red, green, and blue). For
    example, specifying `1 0 0` results in the transmission of red light
    only.

Transmission Size:
    #id: tt_size

    Controls the angular spread of the transmission. Low values result in
    transmission over a narrow cone of angles, and high values result in
    transmission over a broader cone.

Transmission Shift:
    #id: tt_shift

    Controls the general direction of the transmission. Values range from
    `-1` (towards the hair's root) to `1` (towards the hair's tip).  A
    value of `0` results in a direction perpendicular to the hair.  The
    effect of this parameter is most noticeable with a small transmission
    size.

@inputs

nN:
    Normalized surface normal.

@outputs

f:
    The transmission BSDF.
