"""Reads, writes, or caches geometry on disk."""

== Overview ==

This node has two modes of operation. _If its input is connected_, you can choose a __File mode__ to control how the node reads, writes, or caches geometry on disk. If no input is connected, you can specify a geometry file to read in from disk and send through the node's output.

It also supports reading, but not writing, of `.sim` and `.simdata` files
created from File and File Data DOPs.

== Tips ==

* You can also write out the geometry from _any surface node_ as a one-shot action by right-clicking the node and choosing __Save Geometry__.
    
    To set up a procedural workflow where the geometry
    output of a surface node network is always written to disk as part of a render dependency network, set up a
    [Geometry render driver|Node:out/geometry].

* You can "import" the loaded geometry into the `.hip` file so it works without the external file by [locking the File node|/model/lock_nodes].

@parameters

File Mode:
    How this node reads/writes the geometry to/from the disk file.

    This parameter is only available when the node's input is
    connected.

    Automatic:
        Writes the file if it doesn't exist, reads it if it does
        exist.
        
        This is useful for caching, where the node will
        write the cache to disk the first time it cooks, and
        use the cache file from then on.
        
        To force a refresh of the cache, manually delete the file
        on disk.
    
    Read Files:
        Reads the geometry from the file. If the node's input
        is connected, it's ignored.
        
    Write Files:
        Writes the input geometry to disk.
        
    No Operation:
        No file access will occur. Pass through the input geometry
        to the output, like a [Null surface node|Node:sop/null].

Geometry File:
    #id: file

    The name of the file to read or write.

Reload Geometry:
    #id: reload

    Force a reload of the file.  This will also clear any cached data for
    packed disk primitives (see also the [geocache|Cmd:geocache] command).

Object Mask:
    When loading `.sim` files this determines which objects should
    be loaded from disk.  Any objects matching this pattern will
    be loaded.

Geometry Data Path:
    For each object loaded from a `.sim` file, any data attached to
    the object that matches this path will be loaded.  Patterns
    like `*` can be used to match multiple data.  If blank, only the
    Geometry data will be loaded.

Missing Frame:
    What should be done if the specified file does not exist on disk.
    This is only used if in Read Files mode.  By default, if no file
    of the given name exists, the SOP will error.  This can be
    troublesome in a network that can recover from the error.  In
    these cases the behavior can be set to No Geometry so only a
    warning is posted.

    Note that in No Geometry mode, if an input exists to the File SOP,
    it will be passed through.  This allows the File SOP to become a
    read-only cache.

Load:
    Some file formats, in particular `.bgeo`, `.bgeo.sc`, and `.geo`, contain meta-data in the header than can be loaded without loading the entire file. This is useful for dealing with large data sets.
    
    All Geometry:
        Loads the whole file. Potentially with some parts delayed (see below)

    Info:
        Creates one point if the file loads successfully and attach attributes for each named component of the meta-data.

    Info Bounding Box:
        Tries to build a bounding box using the information stored in the header of the file.

    Point Cloud:
        Tries to load just the points from a disk file.  This will be faster and use less memory than loading primitives.

    Packed Disk Primitive:
        Instead of loading the geometry into memory, create a packed disk primitive.  Copies of the delayed load primitive will share geometry meaning that multiple copies will use less memory.

    Packed Disk Sequence:
        Instead of loading the geometry into memory, this will create a packed disk sequence primitive.  Unlike a packed disk primitive, the packed disk sequence stores a list of filenames along with an index of which file to unpack during rendering.  Since the packed disk sequence primitive is aware of all the files in the disk sequence, it is able to compute blended sub-frame geometry at render time (provided topology matches between frames).  This means that motion blur can be computed correctly. When creating the packed disk sequence primitive, the __Geometry File__ parameter is evaluated for each frame in the frame range.  The index of the packed disk sequence primitive is set to the value of the __Sequence Index__ parameter.

Pack Using Expanded/Absolute File Path:
    When loading the geometry as __Packed Disk Primitive__, this toggle controls whether the file name stored with the primitive will have variables expanded.  By default, variables will be preserved. For example, a file such as `$HIP/geo/tree.bgeo` will be portable if the value of the `$HIP` variable changes.  This is only important if you are saving the packed primitive to disk and may move the geometry file.

    When storing variables in the packed primitive (i.e. the toggle is turned off), the primitive itself performs variable expansion.  Since the primitive can be accessed in applications other than Houdini (`mantra`, `gplay`, `gconvert`, etc.), the expansion of variables is limited in function.  For example, using variables local to the .hip file or using expressions which reference other nodes may not work as expected.

Display As:
    When loading the geometry as __Packed Disk Primitive__ or when delayed loading, you can set the viewport display to a lighter representation of the packed geometry.  This setting only applies to rendering in the viewport, at render time, the full geometry will be rendered.

    Use File Setting:
        Packed primitives have viewport display settings that are saved to file. This option reads these and uses them. All others override the saved setting. 

    Full Geometry:
        The full geometry will be displayed in the viewport.

    Point Cloud:
        Only the points of the geometry will be displayed.  This will take less memory and be faster to render.

    Bounding Box:
        Only display the bounding box of the geometry in the viewport.

    Centroid:
        Display a single point at the center of the bounding box.

    Hidden:
        Don't display the geometry in the viewport.

Delay Load Geometry:
    If this parameter is set, packed primitives and other shared data will not be loaded immediately but will be loaded only as needed. This can be useful when opening a large scene to reduce load times.  

Create Intermediate Directories:
    Create intermediate parent directories for output files as needed.

Cache Frames:
    The total number of frames to cache in memory.  These sorted by filename,
    not by time, so if multiple frames evaluate to the same file name they will
    share the same cached geometry.  

    NOTE:
        A value of 1 is almost the same as the default behavior of the File SOP.  However, the new geometry will be loaded before the old geometry is freed.  When loading agent primitives, this avoids possible flushing shared agent shape caches.

Pre-fetch Geometry:
    Attempt to predict the next frame that will be needed and load it in
    the background.  This lets computation be overlapped with file IO.

    If you are blending multiple frames, the Cache Frames needs to be large
    enough for only the net-new frame to be loaded each cook.  Otherwise
    the simple predictive model of the prefetcher will be confused and
    stop working.

Frame Range:
    When creating __Packed Disk Sequence__ primitives, this parameter specifies the number of filenames in the disk sequence.  When evaluating the __Geometry File__, the `$F`, and `$FF` variables will be set to the values in the frame range.

Sequence Index:
    When creating __Packed Disk Sequence__ primitives, this parameter specifies which geometry from the sequence will be used at render time.  The index is linear, with values between 0 and the number of geometry files in the disk sequence (not based on the frame number).  Index values out of range will automatically wrap to generate animation cycles.

    The index values can have non-integer values.  If the topology matches between disk files, the geometry will be blended at render time.  See also the `vm_pack_sequencesubsteps` rendering property.

TIP:
    To offset a sequence of images or geo files when you have padding in your frames, you should enter something like this:
    {{{    
    <path_to_image>/frame`padzero(3, $F+1)`.tga
    }}}

    Where 3 is the number of digits in your sequence, for example 001 is pad 3, 0002 pad 4, etc. The back ticks are necessary so the expression gets evaluated inside the string parameter.

Wrap Mode:
    When creating __Packed Disk Sequence__ primitives, this parameter specifies behavior when __Sequence Index__ is outside of the frame range.
    
    Cycle:
        File sequence repeats.

    Clamp:
        First file is used used when __Sequence Index__ is before the range.  Last file is used when __Sequence Index__ is after the range.

    Strict:
        No geometry outside of the range.

    Mirror:
        File sequence repeats with each repetition reversing order.
