"""Edit the channel data by using direct manipulation of cubic or Bezier
handles in the graph of the CHOP."""

This CHOP allows you to edit the channel data by using direct
manipulation of cubic or Bezier handles in the graph of the CHOP.

The CHOP first does a best-fit on the existing samples based on the
__Tolerance__, the __Start-End__ range and the channel Scope.

The CHOP's entire interval or a sub-interval can be edited. The scope
can be used to limit which channels are to be edited. Changing the scope
causes any prior hand-edits to be lost.

In the graph, the solid boxes at the ends of the chop interval can be
moved to shorten the interval to be edited.

The hollow boxes are the handles for editing the interpolation curves.
As soon as one of these is moved, the start-end handles or scope cannot
be changed without losing the hand-edits. To change the interval or
re-edit the curves, turn on __Compute Knots__ again. You can shorten the
edit interval to one sample and edit a single sample.


@parameters

== Spline ==

    Type:
        The type of fitting curves to use, Bezier or Cubic.
    Compute Knots:
        Turn this on to recompute the knots when you modify the error or
        the start or end of the subrange. All previous changes to the
        knots will be erased. Any change to a knot will turn this
        parameter off.
    Unit Values:
        Determines whether the start/end parameters listed below are
        absolute values or relative to the start and end of the
        channels.
    Start:
        #channels: /start

        The start of the subrange.
    End:
        #channels: /end

        The end of the subrange.
    Tolerance:
        #channels: /tolerance

        The error tolerance when fitting curves to the data. Lower error
        tolerances produce a more accurate reconstruction of the
        original data, but may use more curve segments.
