@parameters

Group:
    The faces or edges to collapse. This field is treated as a set
    of edges. Edges that are not part of any entity in the group
    field do not get deleted.

    Normally you will use this operator in the viewer and simply
    select the faces/edges you want, however if you need to you can
    also use a space-separated list of the following codes in this
    field to specify edges:

    [Include:edgespec]

Remove Degenerate:
    Removes any degenerate polygons left after collapsing.

Recompute Point Normals:
    Recomputes point normals (if they exist).
