"""Filters audio input using one of four different filter types."""

This CHOP filters audio input using one of four different filter types.
Incoming channels are broken into chunks that overlap in time.

The second input is the Filter Animation Channels, which allows the filter parameters to be changed over the CHOP's interval. See the [Band EQ CHOP|Node:chop/band] help, or the section in the Common Options of CHOPs called Filter Animation Channels Input.

This CHOP may be time sliced to filter audio in realtime.

See the Pass Filter CHOP section in the Houdini manual for explanation
of filter terminology.


@parameters

    == Filter ==

        Filter:
            Filter type:

            Low Pass Filter:
                All frequencies below the High Cutoff are passed through
                the filter (the "pass band").
            High Pass Filter:
                All frequencies above the Low Cutoff are passed
                through.
            Band Pass Filter:
                All frequencies between the Low and High Cutoff are
                passed through.
            Band Stop Filter:
                All frequencies above the High Cutoff and below the Low
                Cutoff are passed though.
        Low Cutoff:
            The frequency (in Hertz) of the lower cutoff. This value is
            not used by a low pass filter.
        High Cutoff:
            The frequency (in Hertz) of the upper cutoff. This value is
            not used by a high pass filter.
        Pass Gain (dB):
            The gain of passed frequencies, specified in dB (decibels).
            Every increase of 20dB corresponds to a 10-times power
            increase.
        Rolloff Factor:
            How the filter drops off at the cutoff frequencies. Low
            values (less than one) produce more gradual rolloff, and
            higher values produce sharper filters.
        Also Filter Phase:
            Normally, the magnitude of the signal is filtered. You can
            optionally filter the phase of the signal.

    == Digital ==

        Filter Chunk:
            This parameter allows you to select the chunk size, to
            balance the demands of animating filter parameters with the
            quality of sound.
        Chunk Overlap:
            How much of the current chunk is overlapped and blended with
            the previous chunk. From zero (no overlap and blending) to
            .95 (95% overlapped). Keep between `.05` to `.3`. Values too
            close to zero will not entirely remove the discontinuity.
        Chunk Discard:
            The chunk to throw away. Since the middle section is most
            accurate, the end sections are discarded. From zero (don't
            discard anything) to `.95` (keep only the middle 5%). Normally
            discard between `.05` and `.2`.
