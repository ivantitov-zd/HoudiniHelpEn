Clear Compositing Cache:
    #action: clear_cop_caches
    
    Releases any memory currently being used by the compositing cache to speed up compositing operations.
    
    The compositing cache can grow very large, especially when compositing over multiple frames. If you're running low on memory, this command can potentially free up a large amount.

Set Keyframe:
    #action: add_key
    
    Adds or saves a keyframe for the selected object at the current frame.

Objects:
    The checkbox items in this submenu let you quickly change certain object animation settings.
    
    :box:
        #display: raised
    
        Always Highlight Object Selection in Viewer:
            #action: highlightobjselection
        
            The selected object is highlighted (drawn in yellow) in
            the viewports. You may want to turn this option off when painting on an object or viewing textures to reduce distraction.
    
        ~~~ Bone Kinematic Override ~~~

        None:
            #action: kin_none
        
            Do not override bone kinematic defaults.
        
        IK Rest Pose:
            #action: kin_rest
        
            See the position of bones as they were posed (that is, the last time they were edited in the bone state).
    
        Capture Pose:
            #action: kin_capt
        
            See the position of bones at the capture frame.

        ~~~ Keep Position when Parenting ~~~
    
        Never:
            #action: keeppos_never
        
            Do not maintain world space position; objects are
            positioned relative to their new parent.
        
        Always:
            #action: keeppos_always
        
            Maintain the current world space position and
            orientation of objects when they are parented.
        
        Use Object Flag:
            #action: keeppos_useflag
        
            Uses the value of an object's Keep Position When Parenting parameter.

        Generally, you want to make sure "Keep Position when Parenting" is set to "Always" before parenting limbs.

        To maintain an object's world space position, Houdini may need to change one or more of the child object's Translation Order, Translate, Rotate or Scale parameters. Because this is undesirable if you have an animation channel on one of those values, "Keep Position When Parenting"" does nothing if the child object has animation on any of those parameters.

Stereo Eye:
    The items in this sub-menu control which sub-camera of the stereo rig to display in the viewport. For more information, see [Stereo Camera Rig|Node:obj/stereocamrig].
    
    :box:
        #display: raised
        
        Stereo:
            #action: eye_stereo
            Use the stereo camera when looking through a stereo camera rig.
    
        Left:
            #action: eye_left
            Use the left eye camera when looking through a stereo camera rig.
        
        Right:
            #action: eye_right
            Use the right eye camera when looking through a stereo camera rig.
    
        Center:
            #action: eye_center
            Use the center camera when looking through a stereo camera rig.

Live Parameter Display during Playback:
    #action: live_updates
    
    Toggle live parameter update on or off. When this is on, Houdini updates parameters in the parameter editor with their current values as the animation plays. For heavy scenes you may want to disable this to speed up playback.

Intercept Mode:
    #action: intercept_mode
    
    Toggle "intercept mode" on or off. When intercept mode is active, any keypresses are routed to the [Keyboard CHOP|Node:chop/keyboard]. This lets you generate channel data using keypresses.

Automatically Add Parameter to Current Take:
    #action: auto_take_mode
    
    Toggle "auto take" mode on or off. When auto take mode is on, all parameters inside a take are unlocked, and any changes to a parameter are automatically added to the current take. See [takes|/basics/takes].

Auto Save:
    #action: auto_save
    
    Toggle "auto save" mode on or off. When auto save mode is on, Houdini automatically saves the scene to a disk file at a regular interval (the default is one minute, you can change it in the [save options|/ref/windows/mainprefs#save]).
    
    Auto-save is always off when you launch Houdini. If you want auto-save you must explicitly turn it on in each session.

== Desktop ==
#display: raised

This menu lets you choose a "desktop" (a saved pane layout). Houdini comes with several task-based layouts. The default desktop is "Build", an all-purpose layout. You can also save your own layout as a new custom desktop using __Desktop > Save Current Desktop As__.

See [pane layouts|/basics/panes] for more information.

New Desktop:
    #action: add_desktop
    
    "Resets" the pane layout to a single pane with a scene viewer tab.

Save Current Desktop:
    #action: save_desktop
    
    Saves any changes to the current layout. This preserves the desktop's current name.
    
    If you want to save the current layout as a new named desktop, use __Save Current Desktop As__ instead.

Save Current Desktop As:
    #action: saveas_desktop
    
    Saves the current layout under a new name. The name will appear in the __Desktop__ menu, allowing you to recall the saved layout.

Save All Desktops:
    #action: save_desktops
    
    Saves any changes to all layouts. Use this if you've modified multiple layouts and want to keep all your changes.

Reload Current Desktop:
    #action: reload_desktop
    
    Resets the current pane layout by re-reading the saved defintion from disk.
    
    This is useful to discard any unsaved changes, or if you know the desktop file has changed since Houdini was started and you want to pick up the changes.
    
Desktops Manager:
    #action: desktop_mgr
    
    Opens the [desktop manager|/ref/windows/desks] allowing you to perform operations on saved layouts, such as duplicate, rename, or delete them.

Reset Main Menu to Top:
    #action: reset_menubar
    
    If you've moved the menu bar into a pane, this puts them back at the top of the main window.
    
    (You can move the menus into a pane using the __Pane interface > Move main menus here__ item in a pane menu.)
    
    On Mac OS the menu bar is always at the top of the main screen, so this has no effect.

Reset Shelf to Top:
    #action: reset_shelf
    
    If you have moved the [shelf|/shelf/] into a pane, this puts it back at the top of the main window.
    
    (You can move the menus into a pane using the __Pane interface > Move main menus here__ item in a pane menu.)
