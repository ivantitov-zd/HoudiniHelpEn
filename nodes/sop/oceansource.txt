"""Generates particles and volumes from ocean "spectrum" volumes for use in simulations"""

This node uses an [Ocean Spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] connected to the first input to generate particles and volumes that can be used to drive [FLIP|Node:dop/flipsolver] simulations of ocean splashes, layers, and tanks.

This node can create thin layers of particles to allow simulation of only a small part of an ocean surface. It can also generate _boundary layers_ that surround the simulated liquid tank and help suppress wave reflections and preserve water volume and velocity over the duration of the simulation.  These boundary layers also enable animation of the __Center__ parameter to track a moving object.

This node will usually be created via shelf tools that apply one of the following presets:

__Guided Ocean Layer__:
    Generates a thin layer of particles on top of a guiding ocean surface. The particles are initialized with ocean velocities. The guiding ocean surface and velocity volumes are used both as a boundary layer and as a guiding surface to drive the thin layer of particles. This preset is most useful for simulating the ocean surface where closely matching the underlying ocean spectrum surface is necessary.

__Wave Tank__:
    Generates a full tank of particles initialized with ocean velocities as well as boundary layer surface and velocity volumes that can be used to update the simulation velocity in the boundary layer.  This preset is most useful for simulations that require a full liquid simulation including interaction with deeper parts of an ocean.

__Flat Tank__:
    Similar to the output from the [Particle Fluid Tank|Node:sop/particlefluidtank] with the addition of a boundary layer, allowing particles to exit the simulation and the tank to track a moving object by animating the Center parameter.

@parameters

Initialize:
    Initialize the parameters to the specified preset.

Particle Separation:
    The smallest distance between any two generated particles in the initial configuration.

Oversampling:
    The amount to oversample the particles.  For example, a value of 2 will create twice as many particles.

Grid Scale:
    The voxel size of any volumes created will be the product of this parameter and the __Particle Separation__.

Size:
    The size of the set of particles or volumes created by this node.

Center:
    The center of the set of particles or volumes created by this node.

== Particles == (particles)

Create Particles:
    Generate particles with ocean velocities within the ocean surface and the specified box.

Water Level:
    The top level of the particles _before_ being deformed by the ocean surface.  A value of zero represents the surface of the ocean.

Fill Volume:
    Fill the bottom of the tank with particles, starting at the __Water Level__ value.

Layer Size:
    Specifies the size of the layer of particles to create.

Guiding Surface Thickness:
    Specifies the size of the guiding surface applied to the _FLIP_ simulation.

Jitter Seed:
    Random seed for creating jitter.

Jitter Scale:
    The amount of jitter to apply to the positional values of the particles.

Kill Inside Collision:
    Delete any particles inside any collision objects plugged into the second input.

== Surface == (surface)

Depth:
    The __Surface SDF__ will represent the ocean at the specified depth.  
    This differs from simply offsetting the output surface SDF as it
    takes into account the __Depth Falloff__ setting.

Smoothing:
    Controls the radius of the points used to generate volumes.  Higher values are more expensive but give smoother volumes.

== Velocity == (velocity)

Velocity Field:
    Output a field containing the ocean velocity values.

Max Extrap Cells:
    When generating velocity volumes, how many voxels from the ocean surface to extrapolate velocity values.

== Boundary Layer == (boundary)

Create Boundary Layer:
    Create a small layer around the perimeter of the simulation to maintain surface and velocity. Enabling this layer will decrease the
    size of the active simulation by the amount specific in the __Padding__ parameters.

Lower Padding:
    The size of the layer extruded into the simulation from the lower simulation boundaries. Set this parameter to zero to disable the layer on any given axis.

Upper Padding:
    The size of the layer extruded into the simulation from the upper simulation boundaries. Set this parameter to zero to disable the layer on any given axis.

== Surface Evaluation == (evaluate)

Type:
    The type of surface to evaluate, __Ocean__ or __Flat__.  The parameters for the __Ocean__ type are from an embedded [Ocean Evaluate|Node:sop/oceanevaluate] SOP. The parameters for the __Flat__ type are from an embedded [Particle Fluid Tank|Node:sop/particlefluidtank] SOP.

Time:
    The time at which to evaluate the ocean surface.

Downsample:
    Downsample the incoming ocean spectrum before evaluating any ocean values.  This parameter specifies the number of powers of two to remove from the resolution of the incoming ocean spectrum. For example, if the spectrum was originally specified at resolution 10 to generate a 1024 x 1024 volume, downsampling by 2 will evaluate ocean volumes at resolution 8, a 256 x 256 volume.

    TIP:
        The same high resolution spectrum can be processed by separate [Ocean Evaluate|Node:sop/oceanevaluate] and __Ocean Source__ nodes, for example the former with no downsampling to deform surface geometry, and the latter at a downsampled resolution to generate the more expensive volume or point output.

Max Resolution:
    Downsample the incoming ocean spectra to the specified maximum resolution before evaluating any ocean values.  This parameter is useful to avoid evaluation of very high-resolution spectra when only requiring simulation data, for example.  It can also be more convenient than the __Downsample__ parameter when there are multiple incoming spectra of different resolutions.

Depth Falloff:
    Specifies how deformation and velocity values falloff as the input points lie below the ocean surface.  

    None:
        Values do not falloff below the surface.
    Exponential:
        All values have the same exponential falloff below the surface.
    Exponential by Frequency:
        Values have an exponential falloff that is scaled per wave frequency.  With this setting the contribution from small, high frequency waves falls off very quickly.  It is the most accurate setting and most expensive to compute.

Falloff Scale:
    An additional scale applied to the exponential falloff modes in __Depth Falloff__.  For the most physically accurate values this should be set to 1 in conjunction with the __Exponential by Frequency__ mode.

Depth Divisions:
    The number of divisions along the depth axis if the computed ocean are 3D, as specified by the __Depth Falloff__ parameter.  Higher values are more accurate but more expensive to calculate.

Max Displacement Frame:
    When generating volumes and points, this node needs to calculate the maximum horizontal and vertical displacement in the input ocean waves.  If this parameter is enabled, the displacement will be estimated only once at the specified frame, which is fast, gives a stable point output, and it typically accurate enough for good results.  However, in the case of animated wave amplitudes or quickly varying instacing geometry, it may be necessary to continuously re-calculate the displacement by disabling this parameter.

Scatter Density:
    Scatter points on the surface of the tank, which can help create flat surface for a FLIP simulation.  For a value of 1 the scattered points will be approximately separated by __Particle Separation__. Increasing this value will oversample the surface.

Oversampling Bandwidth:
    The points will be oversampled to this distance from the the surface of the tank if __Oversampling__ is enabled.  This parameter is specified in multiples of the __Particle Separation__.

@inputs
Ocean Spectrum:
    The Ocean Spectrum volume to evaluate when the __Surface Evaluation__ type is __Ocean__.

Collision Geometry:
    Geometry used to cull particles and volumes from within collisions.

@outputs
Initial:
    The Initial output returns geometry consisting of particles used to initialize a [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject].
Maintain:
    The Maintain output returns a volume for the ocean surface and velocity fields when the __Surface Evaluation__ type is __Ocean__.
    These volumes are used in the boundary layer to maintain the ocean dynamics throughout the simulation.
