@parameters

== Parameters ==

[Include:_heightfield_common#combine]
    
[Include:_heightfield_common#blend]
    
Light Direction:
    #id: lightdir
    
    Latitudinal ("horizontal") direction of the light source, in degrees. A value of 0 projects the light along the the +X direction. A value of +90 projects light along the -Z direction.

Light Angle:
    #id: lightangle
    
    Longitudinal ("vertical") angle of the light source, in degrees. Lower numbers give a lower angle and longer shadows.
    
Opacity:
    #id: opacity
    
    The value to set the mask to in shadowed areas.
    
Distance Falloff:
    #id: falloff
    
    Amount of feathering to use around the borders of shadows. Set this to 0 to get sharp shadows, or increase to blur inside the edges.

Invert Mask:
    #id: invertmask
    
    Invert the mask, so the mask shows non-shadowed areas.
