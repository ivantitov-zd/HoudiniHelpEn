#bestbet: group

== Overview ==

Groups are named collections of points or faces.

The [Group surface node|Node:sop/group] lets you sort points or
faces in its input geometry into groups based on an various criteria.
Other operators may also create groups as a side effect.

Most nodes that operate on points or primitives give you the option to apply the
node's effects only to one or more groups in the input stream, instead of every
point/primitive. So, you can identify groups of points based on certain
properties, and then only apply some nodes to those groups, and not other
points.

When a point is deleted, Houdini automatically removes the point from
all the point groups it belongs to.

== Ordered and unordered groups ==

A point group can be _ordered_ or _unordered_. Unordered groups
store their points in creation order; ordered groups store points in
selection order.

When you select points in the viewer pane, a single click performs
an ordered selection, while a marquee box generates an unordered
group. (The only time bulk selections generate or maintain an
ordered selection is when only one point is caught in the marquee
box.)

:task:Create a point or primitive group:
    # Set the  [selection type|/basics/select]  to points (choose
      __Select > Selection Type > Points__ or press ((2))) or
      primitives (choose __Select > Selection Type > Primitives__ or
      press ((4))).

    # In the viewer, use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose
      [Group Geometry|Node:sop/group].

    # Select the points/primitives you want in the new group, then
      click ((RMB)) to finish the selection.

    # In the parameter editor, set the name of the new group in the
      __Group name__ field on the __Create__ tab.

:task:Use existing groups when selecting points/primitives for a new group:
    # Choose the Group operator.

    # In the  [operation controls toolbar|/basics/tools] , choose the
      name of an existing group from the pop-up menu.

    # Use the buttons in the toolbar to change the current selection
      based on the group selected in the pop-up menu:


== Combine and filter groups ==

The controls on the [Group node|Node:pop/group]'s __Combine__ tab
let you create a group that is a combination of existing groups.

steps>>
    # [Create|/model/groups] a [Group node|Node:sop/group] and connect
      the geometry containing the groups to it.

    # In the parameter editor, click the __Combine__ tab.

    # Enter the name of the new group to create in the left-hand field
      on the first row.

    # Enter the name of the group from which to take particles in the
      right-hand field (or click the box beside the equal sign so the
      exclamation point is visible if you want to start with particles
      _not_ in the right-hand group).

      Once you set up the top row, additional rows become available to
      further combine and/or filter the contents of the new group.

    # For the additional rows, on the right-hand side, enter the name of
      another group of particles you want to combine with or filter from
      the new group.

    # Use the menu on the left side to choose how to combine/filter the
      groups.

    # Use the menu to choose how to combine this group with the new
      group.

      Click the box beside the equal sign so the exclamation point is
      visible if you want to do the logical opposite of the operation in
      the menu.


== Group syntax == (manual)

#index: document

Many geometry operators (SOPs) work on a specific subset of points or
primitives. When you use the operator in the viewer, you select the
points/primitives you want to use. In the parameter editor, this list of
points/primitives is specified in the __Group__ parameter using the
following patterns.

You can use multiple patterns separated by spaces. The matches for each
pattern are combined to form the group.

Pattern ||
    Meaning ||
`*` |
    In the Group SOP: all points/primitives. In other SOPs:
    every named group.

`<<n>>` |
    Component number <<n>>.

`<<group_name>>` |
    In SOPs other than the Group SOP, you can specify a named
    group of points/primitives (created with the Group SOP).

    You can use pattern matching (`*`, `?`, and `[ ]`) in the
    group name. For example, `arm*` includes all point/primitive
    groups whose names start with `arm`. `^` can be used in the
    pattern by enclosing the pattern in `{` `}`.  For example,
    `{arm* ^arm3*}` includes all groups whose names start with
    `arm`, but not `arm3`.

`<<n>>-<<m>>` |
    Components numbered from <<n>> to <<m>> (inclusive).

`<<n>>-<<m>>:<<step>>` |
    Components numbered from <<n>> to <<m>> (inclusive)
    skipping every <<step>>. For example, `1-100:2` means every
    other number from 1 to 100.

`<<n>>-<<m>>:<<keep>>,<<step>>` |
    Components numbered from <<n>> to <<m>> (inclusive).
    Use the first <<keep>> numbers and then skip every <<step>>
    after that.

`!<<pattern>> ` |
    Every component except the ones matching the pattern.
    For example, `!1-10` means every point/primitive except the
    numbers 1 to 10.

    <<pattern>> may be a numeric pattern, attribute pattern, or
    group name pattern.

`^<<pattern>>` |
    Remove components matching the pattern from the
    results of the preceding pattern. For example, `0-100:2
    ^10-20` means every other number from 1 to 100 except the
    numbers 10 to 20.

    <<pattern>> may be a numeric pattern, attribute pattern, or
    group name pattern.

`@<<attribute>><<op>><<value>>` |
    Components where <<attribute>> matches
    <<value>>, based on the <<op>>, which can be one of
    `=`, `==` (same as `=`), `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, or `<=`.

    For example, `@v>0` will create a group of all points
    whose `v` attribute is greater than `0`.

    You can specify components using `[<<index>>]` after the
    attribute name, for example `@Cd[2]` will get the blue channel
    of the diffuse color (`Cd`) attribute.
    
    As a convenience, you can also use `.x`/`.r`/`.u`, `.y`/`.g`/`.v`, and `.z`/`.b`/`.w` instead of `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[2]`. For example `P.x` to get the X-axis component of the
    position (`P`) attribute.
    
    (If you don't specify a component for a multi-component attribute type, the comparison will use the first component.)

    For example, `@P.y>0` will create a group of all points
    whose Y component is greater than 0.

    For string attributes you must put quotation marks around the
    <<value>> if it contains spaces, for example
    `@myattr="foo bar"`.

    You can use wildcards (`*` and `?`) in the <<value>> when
    using `=`, `==`, and `!=` on string attributes.

    You can combine the attribute syntax and the range syntax:

    {{{
    @id=5-10
    }}}

    You can also use the attribute syntax with a space separated
    list of integer values, but you need to enclose the list in quotes:

    {{{
    @id="5 8 10 15"
    }}}
    
    You can use this to compare against [intrinsic attributes|attributes#intrinsic] as well:
    
    {{{
    @intrinsic:indexorder<100
    }}}

`@<<attribute>>=<<val>>,<<val>>,...` |
    Components with the given attribute containing one of the listed values.
    For example:
    
    {{{
    @id=1,2,90,120
    }}}
    
    For string attributes, you must enclose values containing spaces in double quotes, for example:
    
    {{{
    @path=/foo/*,/bar,"some string"
    }}}
