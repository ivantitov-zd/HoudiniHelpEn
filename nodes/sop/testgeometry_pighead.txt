= Test Geometry: Pig Head =

"""Creates a pig head, which can be used as test geometry.."""

Test geometry provides some built in geometry to prototype and experiment with. Not only does it provide a more interesting starting point than a torus, but it is also more representative of the sort of geometry your effect will have to deal with: multiple components, holes, and not perfect geometry.

NOTE:
    A normal pig has forty-four teeth.  This pig has none.

@parameters
    Translate:
        Position of the center.

    Uniform Scale:
        Uniform scaling.

    Difficulty:
	Increasing the difficulty adds more problematic issues to the incoming
	model and brings it closer to the sort of models your tool
	will likely have to deal with.

	Easy:
	    Clean mesh with well-sized polygons.
	Medium:
	    Single watertight mesh with texture maps.
	Hard:
	    Open meshes with multiple components.
