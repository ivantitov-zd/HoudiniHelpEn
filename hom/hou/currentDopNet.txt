"""Returns the DOP Network node set as the "current" simulation in the UI."""

:usage: `currentDopNet()` -> [Hom:hou.Node]

The "current" DOP network is the network the shelf tools put new nodes into. The user can change this using the simulation menu in the bottom right corner of the main window.

If you're building a shelf tool that creates simulation nodes, you should use this function to know where to put them.

Call [Hom:hou.setCurrentDopNet] to set the current simulation network programatically.
