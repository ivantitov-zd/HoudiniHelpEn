""" Samples texture map information to a point attribute."""

The Attrib From Map operator creates a point attribute from the color information found in an image (sequence) or previously applied texture. This image can be loaded from disk or already be present as `Cd`. 

You can use this node to create density, fuel, and temperature data to drive a fluid simulation. Using the [Fluid Source|Node:sop/fluidsource] operator, this data can become a set of volumes to be used as a source for a fluid simulation.

NOTE:
    This operator uses point UV's. If no UV's are found (on either vertices or points),
    a default __Orthographic__ mapping operation is applied.

@parameters
Point Group:
    Group of points to sample.
Texture Map:
    When enabled, specifies the image or image sequence to sample the color
    information from. If disabled, the default `Cd` (point color value) is
    used.
UDIM Filename Expansion:
    Expand UDIM texture names when evaluating.
Texture Channel:
    Which channel of deep images to read.
UV Attribute:
    #id: uvattrib

    The name of the texture coordinate attribute to use for looking up into the map, defaulting to `uv`.
Export Attribute:
    Name of attribute to create and store information on.
    A float attribute samples the image's greyscale or specific color band
    (RGB). A vector attribute samples the full color representation (RGB).
	
== Color Settings == 

Color Channel:
    When sampling to a float, __Color Channel__ selects what color (or
    combination of colors) to sample. Greyscale is the default and creates a
    grey scale representation of the image to store as an attribute.
Color Influence:
    Only available when __Color Channel__ is set to __Greyscale__. This
    controls how much influence every band of color has on the greyscale
    representation of the image. It is based on Photoshop greyscale defaults.

    Values run from 0 to 1.
Visualize:
    Overrides `Cd` with the sampled color information to visualize the output.
Do Remap:
    Controls if scaling, contrast, and remapping is done.  

    NOTE:
        If remapping is done, the input values may be clamped.
Scale:
    Scales the final outcome.
Contrast:
    Sharpens the image.
Contrast Rolloff:
    Specifies where __Contrast__ is allowed to effect the image. A value of 1
    is everywhere. The lower the value, the less influence __Contrast__ has.
Remap Influence:
    This is only available when sampling to a float. Remaps the sampled range.

== Filter Settings ==

Type:
    Type of filter to use.
Filter Width:
    Filter amount in UV space.
Wrap:
    Sets the behavior of the filter when attempting to sample pixels outside
    of the image's region.
    
    Repeat:
	The image is sampled as if it were infinitely tiled.
	
    Streak:
	The image is sampled as if the border extended to infinity.
	
    Decal:
	The image is surrounded by a solid color. Use the __Border Color__
	parameter to set this color.
	
Border Color:
    The color to use if sampling outside the image in Decal mode.
    
== Image Settings ==

Set of basic UV operators. For more control, use the [UV Edit|Node:sop/uvedit] operator.

Invert U:
    Inverts U texture coordinates.
Invert V:
    Inverts V texture coordinates.
Scale:
    Scales the UVs and the image.
Rotate:
    Rotates the UVs in degrees.
Translate:
    Translates UVs in UV space.
	
@inputs
    Points or Primitives:
    	Geometry to sample.  If no UVs are found (on either vertices or points),
    	a default __Orthographic__ mapping operation is applied.
