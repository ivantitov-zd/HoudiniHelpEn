This function is a sub-set of the waveform CHOP.

@parameters

== Waveform ==

    Wave Type:
        The wave type which is one of the following:
    
        Constant:
            A constant valued "wave".
        Sine:
            A sine wave.
        Gaussian:
            A Gaussian wave (also known as bell or normal curve).
        Triangle:
            A triangular sawtooth wave.
        Square:
            A square wave.
        Pulse:
            A periodic one-sample pulse wave.
        Expression:
            A user defined non-periodic expression.
    Period:
        #channels: /period
    
        The period of the wave.
    Phase:
        #channels: /phase
    
        The phase of the wave, from `0` to `1`.
    Bias:
        #channels: /bias
    
        The bias of the waveform. Only Gaussian, triangle and square
        waves have biases.
    Offset:
        #channels: /offset
    
        The value offset of the waveform.
    Amplitude:
        #channels: /amp
    
        The amplitude of the waveform.
    Decay:
        #channels: /decay
    
        The decay rate of the waveform, represented as the fraction
        of decay after `1` Unit of time (default is one second)
    Ramp Slope:
        #channels: /ramp
    
        A ramp is added the wave: amount per Unit of time.

== Channel ==

    Align:
        The alignment option to use.

        Extend to Min/Max:
            Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all
            inputs to that range using the extend conditions.
        Stretch to Min/Max:
            Find the earliest start and latest end, and stretch every
            channel's start and end to that range.
        Shift to Minimum:
            Find the earliest start and shift all channels so they all
            start at that index. All channels are extended to the length
            of the longest one.
        Shift to Maximum:
            Find the latest end and shift all channels so they all end
            at that index. Extend all channels to the length of the
            longest one.
        Shift to First Interval:
            Shift all channels to the start of the first channel and
            sample all inputs using the first input's range.
        Trim to First Interval:
            Trim all channels to first channel's range.
        Stretch to First Interval:
            Stretch all channels to the first channel's range.
        Trim to Smallest Interval:
            Trim all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The
            start and end values may not come from the same channel.
        Stretch to Smallest Interval:
            Stretch all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The
            start and end values may not come from the same channel.
    
    Channel Name:
        The names of the channels to create. Patterns like `chan[1-20]` generate multiple channels.
    Channel Range:
	Indicates how much of the channel to cook.

	Use Full Animation Range:
	    All of the current global animation range.
	Use Current Frame:
	    Only the sample at the current frame.
	Use Start/End:
	    Specify the range using the Start/End parameters.
    Start, End:
        #channels: /start /end
    
        The start time of the channels.
    Sample Rate:
        #channels: /rate
    
        The sample rate of the channels.
