"""Supports Bone Deform by assigning capture weights to bones."""

The closer the point is to the boundary of a
Capture Region, the lighter the assigned capture weight to that region
will be.

The optional second input can be used to specify extra capture regions
to process in addition to those in the Parent Object hierarchy.

The Bone Capture operation will not visibly change the geometry (except
to possibly add point colors for feedback). To actually change the
geometry by animating the Capture Regions, append a Bone Deform operation.

Typically one or more Capture Regions are placed in an object (usually a
bone) and named "cregion". The object is then read into a Bone Capture
operation through the object's hierarchy. The object is moved to deform
the Bone Capture operation's geometry with a Bone Deform operation.

The weighting scheme is described in the next section, [Capture Edit
SOP|Node:sop/capturecorrect].

NOTE:
    When a hip file is loaded, all of the associated capture regions are
    evaluated at the capture frame. Keyframes must be set to position
    the capture regions properly at the capture frame. Otherwise, the
    geometry will be weighted incorrectly upon subsequent file loads.

@parameters
    Group:
        Optional point group to capture.

    == Capture ==

        Hierarchy:
            Top of the object hierarchy traversed for Capture Region
            operations. This may be empty if the Extra Regions parameter
            is given.
        Extra Regions:
            The list of paths to extra bone objects or capture regions
            to be used separated by spaces. This list is appended to
            what the Hierarchy parameter specifies.
        Region SOP:
            Specifies the operations in which to find the Capture
            Regions.
        Traverse into subnets:
            If turned on, when traversing the hierarchy for capture
            regions, also traverse inside object subnets.
        Create Relative Skeleton Root Path:
            If on, then the internal cregion paths are generated with a
            skeleton path prefix that is relative to this sop. If off,
            then the prefix is determined by the longest common object
            path prefix out of all the capture region paths.
        Use Capture Pose:
            If turned on, the capture parameters of bones and capture
            regions are used to capture points. This means that the
            arrangement of bones and the shapes of capture regions are
            capture frame independent. The capture pose can be viewed by
            choosing __Edit > Objects > Bone Kinematic Override: Capture Pose__
            from the menu.
        Capture Frame:
            Frame number at which to compute the capture weighting. This
            frame will cook slower than other frames due to the
            weighting computation.
        Weight From:
            Weight from either the point location or surface location
            (for NURBS or Bezier surfaces).
        Normalize Weights:
            Adjusts the capture weights so they add up to one for every
            point. This makes the paint tools easier to use. For
            backwards compatibility, this should be changed to off.
        Destroy Existing Weights:
            Destroy any existing capture weights.
        Blend Factor:
            If destroy existing weights is off, then this parameter
            determines the blend factor of the created capture weights
            with the existing ones.
        Point Coloring:
            Adds point color attributes to show the weighting of the
            points. The color of each point will be a blend of the
            colors of its captured regions.
        Zero Weight Point Color:
            Color used for points with zero weight.

    == Override ==

        Override File:
            Capture override file name (.ocapt extension). The file is
            loaded at the capture frame after the default weight
            computation. Please refer to the documentation for the
            .ocapt file format.
        Save File:
            File name for saving override files with the current
            weighting data.
        Increment Save File:
            Increments "Save File" name before saving.
        Save All Data to File:
            Save the weighting of all points to the Save File.
        Save Selected Points to File:
            Save the weighting of selected points to the Save File. Note
            that you must be editing this geometry in the viewport.
            
        Force Recapture:
            Forces the node to recook.
