"""Applies force to agents/particles to avoid potential collisions with static objects."""

This is a [crowd behavior|/crowds/states] node, but you can also use it on regular particles (see the __Output attribute__ parameter).

This node sends out a certain number of rays in a cone along its forward direction, and tries to avoid collisions based on the closest ray hit. It looks for the optimal path based on the least obstructed ray, and uses environment normal directions as the braking direction.

See [crowd obstacles|/crowds/obstacles] for how to set up obstacles using shelf tools.

Source:
    Whether to get the obstacle geometry from a geometry (SOP) node, or a piece of simulation (DOP) data.

SOP Path:
    When __Source__ is "SOP", the path to an object (for example `/obj/house`) or geometry node (for example, `/obj/house/walls`) containing the obstacle geometry.

Obstacle DOP Data:
    When __Source__ is "DOP Data", the name of a piece of geometry data, such as created by a [Static Object DOP|Node:dop/staticobject].

Collision Padding:
    Increases the effective size of the object. This can be used to control how close to the geometry agents can be.

[Include:/nodes/dop/popsteeravoid#particlescale]

Far Avoidance Force:
	Amount of force applied to alter agent path to avoid the obstacle. This force follows a linear model and is useful for long range anticipatory avoidance. This can be mixed with a Near Avoidance Force.

Near Avoidance Force:
	Amount of force applied to alter agent path to avoid the obstacle. This force follows a non-linear model which produces better results for short range anticipatory avoidance and for dense crowds. This can be mixed with a Far Avoidance Force.
    
Front Search Distance:
	The maximum distance (in meters) in front of the agent to look for collisions with the obstacle geometry.
    
Samples:
	Number of rays to send out looking for possible collisions. The more rays you send, the earlier and more accurate the avoidance will be, but the slower the node will operate.
    
Samples Seed:
	Seed for the random number generator used to generate sample rays.
    
Sample Weight Bias:
	Bias for longer ray samples to have more influence.

FOV Horizontal:
	Field of view (in degrees) in the horizontal direction.
    
FOV Vertical:
	Field of view (in degrees) in the vertical direction.
    
Terrain Projection:
	Option for whether to project the obstacle avoidance force onto a terrain.
