"""Transfer hair guides between geometries."""

This operator allows you to transfer a set of hair guides to a new skin geometry. Using the UV-based transfer method, this is possible even if the skin geometries are in different locations and have different topology.

@parameters

== Transfer ==

Match Method:
    #id: matchmethod
    Direct (Matching Topology):
	    Assumes identical topology between the source and target skin geometry.
	    
    Use UV:
	    Transfers guides based on UV coordinates. This makes it possible transfer between skin geometries with differing topology.

Attribute Class:
    #id: uvattribclass
    The class of the UV attribute (__Point__ or __Vertex__).

UV Attribute:
    #id: uvattrib
    The name of the UV attribute.

== Deformation ==

Deform Guides:
    #id: deform
    Blends between two different transfer methods. At `0` guides are transformed from the root, at `1` guides are deformed using the [Point Deform SOP|Node:sop/pointdeform].
    
Radius:
    #id: pointdeform_radius
    The radius used by the deform method (used when __Deform Guides__) is not `0`.
