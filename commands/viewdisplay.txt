= viewdisplay =

"""Set various options of a viewport or view-memory."""

:usage: `viewdisplay [<<options>>] <<viewports/view-memories>> `

If you specify a view-memory that doesn't exist, the command will create
it.

The `-M`, `-N`, `-E`, and `-I` options are obsolete.  Use [CMD:viewdispset] instead.

See [how to refer to viewers and viewports|/commands/_guide#viewers] .
