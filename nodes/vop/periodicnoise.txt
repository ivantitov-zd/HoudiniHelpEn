"""Generates 1D and 3D Perlin noise from 1D, 3D and 4D data."""

This operator generates 1D and 3D Perlin noise from 1D, 3D and 4D data.
There are two forms of Perlin noise: a non-periodic noise which changes
randomly throughout the N-dimensional space, and a periodic form which
repeats itself over a given range of the space. The periodic form can be
used to generate patterns which 'tile' over N-dimensional space (i.e. a
noise-based texture map which repeats seamlessly).

To compute periodic noise, you must plug the value of your choice into
the Periodicity (`period`) input. In the Surface Shading context, for
example, pipe a [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] into `pos` and a Constant of type vector
and values { 12, 12, 12 } into `period`. Then, pipe the `noise` output
into the `bias` input of [Color Mix|Node:vop/colormix] to generate a noisy color. To
visualize the result, connect the [Color Mix|Node:vop/colormix] output into the `Cf` input
of the Output Variables operator.

The noise has a range of (0, 1) with a median value of 0.5. The
distribution of the noise depends on the dimension, with higher
dimensions approaching a Gaussian distribution of noise values.

Unlike the Perlin option available in the [Turbulent Noise|Node:vop/turbnoise] operator,
this operator does not do any iterations of the noise, nor does it use
turbulence, amplitude or roughness.

The relative costs for computing noise of different types is roughly:
