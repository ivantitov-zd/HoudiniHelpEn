"""A microsolver that updates the strain field according to the current
velocity field."""

The Gas Strain Integrate DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations.
The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Strain Integrate DOP updates a strain field according to the
given velocity field. The shears present in the velocity field are used
to compute the strain it imparts and this is added to the strain field.
The strain field itself is slowly relaxed over time to simulate plastic
flow.

@parameters

Strain:
    A matrix field that stores the total accumulated strain in each
    voxel. The strain is a measure of the distortion that the fluid
    in the voxel has undergone.
    
Surface:
    A signed distance field that determines the inside of the
    fluid, and hence where the strain should be integrated. Voxels
    outside the fluid are considered to have zero strain and to be
    able to immediately relieve any pent up strain.
    
Velocity Field:
    A vector field providing the current velocity of the fluid.
    While rigidly moving fluid has no strain, other areas where
    fluid flows unequally from voxel to voxel represents non-rigid
    distortion, and so strain.
    
Alpha:
    This is the rate of plastic flow. The current strain is
    dissipated at this rate per second. A value greater than the
    timestep per second can lead to overshoot.
    
Gamma:
    This is the threshold for plastic flow. When the norm of the
    strain exceeds gamma, the strain is dissipated according to the
    alpha term. This causes the fluid to lose its history and
    permanently enter its new configuration.
