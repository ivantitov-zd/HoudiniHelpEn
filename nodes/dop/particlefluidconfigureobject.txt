= Particle Fluid Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Particle Fluid Objects to an object."""

The Particle Fluid Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and
attaches the data which is needed for it to be used as a [Particle
Fluid Object|Node:dop/particlefluidobject].

This DOP is very similar to the [Particle
Fluid Object|Node:dop/particlefluidobject], except that it
allows you to explicitly control the creation of the object using
another DOP, such as the [Empty Object DOP|Node:dop/emptyobject].

NOTE:
    If this object contains Input Geometry data, this data will be used
    as the source geometry to generate particles inside of.  Position
    data is also required to properly transform the Geometry.


@parameters
Particle Separation:
    This parameter controls the interaction distance between particles in the created [Particle Fluid Object|Node:dop/particlefluidobject]. 

    If the __Input Type__ for this object is set to __Surface SOP__, then this parameter also controls the number of particles spawned inside of the provided surface. That is, a smaller particle separation results in a greater number of particles and hence a particle-based fluid with higher resolution.

Particle Radius Scale:
    The radius of the particles is determined by scaling the __Particle Separation__ by this parameter.  Setting this value higher will result in more volume in the fluid
    but less surface detail as it gets smoothed out by the larger particle radius.

    NOTE:
        In versions prior to Houdini 12, this value was set internally at 2.

Rest Density:
    The physical density of the particle fluid. This quantity is
    used by the [Particle Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver] to determine how to apply pressure forces to particles in the fluid. 

    When the density of particles exceeds their rest density, they are pushed apart.
    Similarly, they are pulled together when their density is less than the fluid rest density.
    
Viscosity:
    This parameter is used by the [Particle Fluid Solver|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver] to control the thickness and resistance to flow of the particle fluid. 

    A fluid with higher viscosity tends to flow more slowly and appear thicker than one with low viscosity.

    NOTE:
    	This only applies to SPH fluids.
	
Surface Tension:
    Controls the magnitude of surface tension forces applied to
    particles in the fluid by the [Particle Fluid Solver|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver]. Surface
    tension forces attempt to pull surface particles more tightly in
    to the fluid, resulting in a more rounded fluid shape.

    NOTE:
    	This only applies to SPH fluids.

== Initial Data ==

Input Type:
    Determines how to interpret the SOP geometry specified
    in __SOP Path__.

    Surface SOP:
        Use this option to generate particles inside of the
        specified surface. 

        The initial separation between particles is determined by the Particle Separation parameter, and so the particle separation also determines the number of particles created.
    
    Particle Field:
        Use this option to generate a fluid
        particle at each point in the specified geometry. 

        This can be used to specify a custom initial distribution for the
        fluid particles or to resume an existing particle fluid simulation.  

        It can also be used to combine multiple fluids with different initial conditions.  When this option is selected, the particle separation is completely independent of the initial particle distribution. This means that changing the particle separation may substantially alter the results of a simulation.  

        However, if the __Initialize Fluid Attributes__ toggle is disabled,
        then the Particle Fluid Object does not create or change any attributes on the imported fluid geometry, and expects those attributes to exist already.
    
    File:
        Use this option to initialize a fluid simulation directly from a `.bgeo` file.  This can be used to easily reinitialize a simulation from saved geometry data.  See the __Fluid Geometry File__ parameter below.
        
Initial Configuration:
    This determines how the initial configuration of fluid particles
    if __Input Type__ is set to __Surface SOP__.

    Grid:
        Particles are generated on an axis-aligned grid inside of
        the surface.
        
    Tetrahedral:
        Particles are generated in a more tightly-packed tetrahedral
        arrangement inside of the surface.  

        This can be useful is the fluid needs to settle quickly inside of a container without losing too much of its initial height.
        
SOP Path:
    The geometry controlling the initial locations of fluid particles. How this is used depends on __Input Type__.
    
Fluid Geometry File:
    The file to load fluid geometry from when __Input Type__ is set to __File__.

    NOTE:
    This field expects a file containing geometry extracted from the __Geometry__ field of a particle fluid object.

    TIP:
        When running a long simulation, it is useful to save `.bgeo` files containing particle fluid geometry at each frame.  The simulation can then be restarted from any frame by specifying one of these files in this field.
        
Use Object Transform:
    The transform of the object containing the chosen SOP is applied to the geometry. This is useful if the initial location of the geometry is defined by an object transform.
    
Jitter Seed:
    When __Input Type__ is set to __Surface SOP__, a random jitter may be applied to the particles created.  This has the effect of making the initial fluid configuration less symmetrical. This parameter is a seed used in the random jitter application.
    
Jitter Scale:
    The magnitude of random jitter to apply to each particle.
    
Initialize Fluid Attributes:
    #id: initfluidattribs
    
    This parameter is only meaningful if __Input Type__ is set
    to __Particle Field__. In this case, when this parameter is
    enabled, the DOP will overwrite any existing attributes used
    by the [Particle Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver] (mass, velocity, density, etc.)
    with new values when it initializes the fluid particles.
    
    Leave this parameter disabled if you wish to initialize a particle fluid object from the particle geometry of an existing particle fluid simulation.  This is the case when you are attempting to restart an old simulation, or combine two or more particle fluid objects in to the same object.

Initialize Velocity:
    #id: initvel
    
    When sourcing from a grid of particles, they may already have a velocity. This option lets you override these velocities with your own constant velocity with the __Initial velocity__ parameter below.

Initial Velocity:
    #id: velocity
    
    The initial velocity of the fluid particles created by this DOP.
    
Initialize Force and Mass:
    #id: initforcemass
    
    If enabled, add force and mass attributes to __Plain__ particle types.
    These attributes are always added to __SPH__ and __Grain__ particles.

Particle Type:
    #id: particletype
    
    Plain:
	    The fewest number of attributes.  Useful for POPs or FLIP fluids.
    
    SPH:
	    Pressure and other attributes required by SPH fluids.
    
    Grains:
	    Adds attributes to instance a 'grain' to each point so the points can have their own unique collection of spheres.  Used by the gas particle forces DOP.

Add Viscosity Attribute:
    A viscosity attribute is added, but not written to.  Its default value is 1 to allow any new particles added to the sim to respect the global viscosity value.

    NOTE:
        The particle viscosity is usually treated as a multiplier, so 1 means to use the global viscosity value.

== Guides ==

Use this tab to quickly visualize the particle fluid object.

Show Guide Geometry:
    Enables or disables particle visualization.
    
Visualization:
    Selects between __Spheres__, __Sprites__, __Grain__, or
    __Particles__ visualization of particles.

    Sphere visualization stamps a scaled sphere at each point.  Sprite will stamp a billboarded sprite.  Grain stamps arbitrary geometry on the points.
    
Scale:
    This controls the size of the spheres in the guide geometry.
    
Color:
    Controls the color of the visualization geometry.
    
Visualization Type:
    Instead of a constant color, one of the particle attributes could
    be visualized.

    None:
	    The color is used for all particles.

    Speed:
	    The length of the attribute is used.  In the case of velocity, this corresponds to the speed.

    Direction:
	    The attribute is normalized to a unit sphere and then scaled to fit into the RGB cube, resulting in a spectrum of colors depending on which way the particle is moving.

    Value:
	    The attribute's raw value is used as the color channels.

Visualization Mode:
    If the attribute is a scalar attribute, or has been turned into a
    scalar attribute by the Speed visualization type, it can be remapped
    into a color spectrum.

Visualization Attrib:
    Which point attribute to visualize as color.

Visualization Scale:
    Before mapping the visualization range, the attribute is multiplied
    by this scale.

Detect Range:
    The minimum and maximum values of the attribute are computed and
    used for the range.  This allows for automatic bounding of the
    range.  The detail attribute `vis_range` will be set to the
    computed range.

Visualization Range:
    This range will be remapped into the 0..1 interval for setting the
    color or mapping by the Visualization Mode.  Using a balanced
    interval, such as -1..1, is useful for detecting zero crossings of
    an attribute along with the Two-Tone visualization mode.

Sprite Image:
    The sprite image to display when __Visualization__ is set to __Sprites__.

== Physical ==

Use this tab to control general DOPs physical parameters for
the particle fluid object.

[Include:standard_physparms]

== Collisions ==

Volume Offset:
    Controls how far away from collision geometry particle collisions occur.  

    If __Volume Offset__ is set to 0, collisions occur directly at the boundary of the collision object.  If it is set to 1.0, then collisions occur one particle radius away from the collision geometry.

== Stored Attributes ==
        
Use this tab to select additional attributes to compute and store during
the simulation.

Density Field Gradient:
    Stores the gradient of the fluid density field at each particle
    position.  

    This may be useful for identifying particles close to the surface of the fluid, as the magnitude of this vector is larger for particles close to the fluid surface than it is for particles far from the surface.

Pressure Force:
    Stores the last pressure force vector computed for each particle.

Neighbor Velocity:
    For each particle, this stores the average velocity of all neighbors
    of the particle.  

    By comparing a particle's velocity with its neighbor velocity, areas of particularly turbulent flow in the fluid may be identified.

== Coordinate System ==
    
Use this tab to generate a simple coordinate system to be carried along
with the fluid.  This coordinate system can later be transferred on to
the fluid surface.  The coordinate system is designed to reinitialize
itself over time, and so at all times it stores two different coordinate
system as well as a blend attribute to blend between the two.
The blend value is stored in the detail attribute "coordinate_transition_state",
while the two coordinate systems are stored in the point attributes
"coordinate1" and "coordinate2".  For each point, if we define
the blend value as __s__ and the coordinates as __c1__ and __c2__, then
a blended coordinate value for that point could be given by
__s * c1 + (1 - s) * c2__.

Create Coordinate System:
    Enables or disables the coordinate system on this object.

Coordinate Transition Period:
    Since any coordinate system on a set of freely moving fluid particles
    is expected to gradually become incoherent, the coordinate system is
    designed to periodically reinitialize itself.  This specifies the
    transition period.

Coordinate Transition Length:
    During each transition period, the coordinate system remains constant
    for some period of time, and then transitions in to a reinitialized
    coordinate system over a specified transition length.  Use this
    parameter to control that transition length.

Coordinate Scale:
    By default, all fluid coordinates are in the range `[0,1]` and are
    defined with respect to the initial bounding box of the fluid.
    Use this parameter to scale the range of each axis from `[0,1]` to
    `[0,<<s>>]` where <<s>> can be specified.

Override Bounding Box:
    By default, all particle coordinates are determined with respect to
    the initial bounding box of the fluid.  This bounding box is
    repeated spatially to accommodate particles that flow out of this
    bounding box.  Use this parameter to define coordinates with respect
    to a different bounding box.

Minimum Bound:
    The minimum boundaries of the user-defined coordinate bounding box.

Maximum Bound:
    The maximum boundaries of the user-defined coordinate bounding box.

== Grain ==
    
Use this tab to select the grain geometry be instanced at each particle location. 

Custom Grain:
        Enables or disables use of a custom defined grain SOP.
Grain SOP Path:
    When __Custom Grain__ is enabled, the custom grain SOP path is defined here. Custom grains must be a set of rigidly-connected spheres.

Grain Shape:
    This options lists a number of default grain shapes.
    
Grain Radius:
    Controls the size of the grains.
    
Sphere Radius:
    Controls the size of the spheres that comprise the grain.
