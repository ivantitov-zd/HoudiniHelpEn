"""A microsolver that applies viscosity to a velocity field."""

The Gas Viscosity DOP is a microsolver used in building
larger fluid simulations. 
Advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Viscosity DOP applies a viscosity effect to a velocity field.
A viscosity force causes nearby parts of the liquid to have similar
velocities.  It can be thought of as a localized drag, where each
part of the fluid is slowed to the speed of neighboring fluid. 

For small amounts of viscosity, a simple [Gas Blur DOP|Node:dop/gasblur] can be used on
a velocity field to achieve this effect.  However, this does not scale to large
viscosities.  It also will dampen rotational motion incorrectly.

The Gas Viscosity DOP performs an implicit solve, similar to what the
[Gas Project Non Divergent Variational DOP|Node:dop/gasprojectnondivergentvariational]. However, it is approximately three times more complicated, so is correspondingly slower.

NOTE:
  For most accurate results, the velocity field provided should already be
  divergence-free, usually as a result of applying the
  [Gas Project Non Divergent Variational DOP |Node:dop/gasprojectnondivergentvariational].
  However, the velocity field produced by the viscosity solve may no longer be divergence-free, so a typical viscous fluid solve will solve for non-divergence before and after the viscosity solve.

@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to apply viscosity to.
    Surface Field:
        An SDF that specifies which voxels are to be considered in the
        viscosity calculations. Voxels are either inside (less than 0)
        or outside. Viscosity is only applied on the interior voxels.
	This avoids 'frame dragging' from the surrounding empty
	liquid.  If not provided, all of the voxels will be considered.
    Surface Weights Field:
	    This field stores what percentage of each voxel is inside the
	    surface field.  It is usually computed with a [Gas SDF To Fog DOP|Node:dop/gassdftofog].
    Viscosity Field:
	A scalar field allowing the viscosity to vary across the
	fluid.  The value of the field is multiplied with the __Scale__.
	If not present, this field is assumed to be 1.
    Collision Field:
        Velocity values on collision boundaries are considered fixed.
    Collision Velocity Field:
	The velocity of each voxel in the collision object.  If not provided,
        the collision velocities will be assumed to be zero.
    Density Field:
	A field that gives the relative inertia of each voxel, allowing
	for viscosity to take different density fluids into consideration. Often the `massdensity` scalar field is
	used to avoid confusion with the traditional `density` field of smoke simulations.  If this solver is used in conjunction with the [Gas Project Non Divergent Variational DOP |Node:dop/gasprojectnondivergentvariational]
        solver, this should be the same field provided to the __Density__
        parameter there.
    Scale:
	The strength of the viscosity effect, multiplied with the
	viscosity field if present.  

        NOTE: 
            One of the viscosity field or the scale parameter need to be scaled to reflect the units of the simulation, but not both.  The standard [Flip Fluid Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] setup uses a dimensionless scale and has the units applied to the viscosity field.

    Min Viscosity:
	The applied viscosity will revert to zero if less than this
	minimum.  This helps avoid ill-conditioned matrices that may
	fail to converge. This value is in units of kinematic viscosity
        (meters-squared / second), and should be equal to the minimum
        valid dynamic viscosity divided by the maximum valid
        fluid density.
    Error Tolerance:
	How much error to allow in solving the viscosity equations.
	Smaller errors will take longer to converge but produce
	more accurate results.
    Surface Extrapolation Cells:
        Extrapolate the surface field into any collision objects if they
        are within this fraction of a voxel.  This can provide more stable
        collisions along curved surfaces, although it can also introduce
        a small amount of stickiness into the fluid-solid collision.
    Samples Per Axis:
        The number of samples per axis for supersampling when computing internal surface weights.
        Total samples is the cube of this, so two samples per axis is actually eight samples.
    Float Precision:
        This determines the floating point precision that is used internally by the viscosity solver. __Float 32 bit__ uses less memory and is generally faster than __Float 64 bit__. However, the extra accuracy of 64-bit floating point numbers may be needed when simulating fluid with very high viscosity or large variations in viscosity.
    Use Preconditioner:
	During the viscosity solve the matrices involved can be
	preconditioned to speed up the solution.  However, this is a
	single threaded process.  On machines with 4+ sockets it may be faster
	to use a simpler Jacobi preconditioner which multithreads well, but
	takes 6x more iterations to converge.  
    Use OpenCL:
        Solve the linear system for viscosity using OpenCL. This setting can accelerate high resolution fluid simulations with high viscosity, 
        when run on a fast GPU.
    Max Solver Iterations:
        The linear solver will terminate after this specified number of iterations and the
        state of the linear system will be written to the velocity field.  This parameter
        should be treated as a failsafe upper limit for the solver.  It should not be used
        to increase performance, it's preferable to modify __Error Tolerance__ instead.
    Compute Collision Weights:
        Compute collision weights for the solver in a similar method as surface weights.
        Using collision weights in the solver helps alleviate grid artifacts that
        can appear at fluid-solid collisions.
    Use Waterline:
	A closed boundary can be set as an open boundary above a specified waterline.
	The height of the waterline boundary at a particular boundary voxel
	is described by the waterline level and the waterline "up" direction.
