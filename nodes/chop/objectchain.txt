= ObjectChain =

"""Creates channels representing the transforms for a chain of objects."""

The ObjectChain CHOP takes a chain of objects and returns information on their
transforms.

TIP:
    This node is especially useful for generating transforms for the
    [Node:chop/iksolver] CHOP.

@parameters

    == Object Chain ==

        Start Object:
            The start object of the chain to obtain transforms from.
            If __Use End Object__ is enabled, this object must be an input ancestor of the __End Object__.
        Use End Object:
            Specifies whether to use the __End Object__ as the end of the chain, or to find all descendants of the __Start Object__.
        End Object:
            End object of the chain to obtain transforms from.
            This object must be an output descendent of the __Start Object__.
        Include Start Object for Subnet:
            If __Use End Object__ is disabled and __Start Object__ is a subnet, include the transform of the subnet (and any outputs) in addition to the transforms of its children.
	Pre-transform Name:
	    If enabled, pre-transforms from the objects are generated as
	    separate tranforms. The text specified here is used as part of the
	    generated channel name to differentiate it from the regular
	    transform channels.
	Fetch Bone Rest Channels:
	    If enabled, this will generate additional channels for these
	    [Node:obj/bone] object parameters: __Rest Angles__, __Bone
	    Length__, and __Dampening__. This is useful for generating channels
	    used by the [Node:chop/iksolver] CHOP.
	Fetch Bone Constraint Channels:
	    If enabled, this will generate additional channels for these
	    [Node:obj/bone] object constraint parameters: __X/Y/Z Angle
	    Range__, __X/Y/Z Damping Angle__, __X/Y/Z Damping Rolloff__.  This
	    is useful for generating channels used by the
	    [Node:chop/iksolver] CHOP.
	Fetch Local Transforms:
	    If enabled, this will generate local transforms for each of the
	    objects in the specified chain. If disabled, full world transforms
	    will be generated instead.

    == Channel ==

        Channel Names:
            Sets how the output channels are named.

            Channel Name:
                Only use the name of the channel.
            OP and Channel Name:
		Include the name of the object with the channel name, separated
		by a colon (:).
            Full Path and Channel Name:
		Include the full path of the object with the channel name,
		separated by a colon (:).
            Relative Path and Channel Name:
		Include the relative path of the object from the __Start Object__'s parent network, along with the channel name (separated by a colon).
                If __Include Start Object for Subnet__ is disabled and __Start Object__ is a subnet, the paths will be relative to __Start Object__.

        Channel Range:
            Indicates how much of the channel to fetch.

            Use Full Animation Range:
                All of the current global animation range.
            Use Current Frame:
                Only the sample at the current frame.
            Use Start/End:
                Specify the range.
        Start:
            The start time of the desired interval of the object path.
	        
            NOTE:
		        The value of this parameter is interpreted using the __Units__ parameter on the Common parameters tab.
        End:
            The end time of the desired interval of the object path.
	        
            NOTE:
		        The value of this parameter is interpreted using the __Units__ parameter on the Common parameters tab.
        
        Sample Rate:
            The sampling rate of the channel in frames per second (Hz).
        Extend Left:
            The left extend conditions.
        Extend Right:
            The right extend conditions.
        Default Value:
            The default value for extend conditions.
