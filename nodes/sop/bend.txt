"""Applies deformations such as bend, taper, squash/stretch, and twist."""

[Image:/images/model/bend_flounder.png]

With the bend operation you define two parallel planes.  The geometry between these planes is then bent, twisted, and deformed.  One plane is the source, and all geometry outside of it remains unchanged.  The other
plane is the destination and all geometry outside of it receives a constant transform.  Geometry in between receives a partial transform.

When doing the name-sake bend operation, the line between the center of the planes is kept at constant length.  A circular arc is fitted between two planes providing a smooth transition from one orientation 
to another.  While distances along the center line are preserved, points outside of or inside of the bend will be distorted.

@parameters
Group:
    Subset of geometry to deform.

    Primitives with transforms (such as spheres, packed primitives, and volumes) will be transformed if their base point is. 
    
Group Type:
    While defined as a point deformer, you can select different group types and operate on the implied set of points.

== Deformation ==

Enable Deformation:
    This toggle turns on and off all deformation.  This is useful for adjusting the capture planes in the pre-deformed space.

Limit Deformation to Capture Region:
    When limited, the deformation is only performed in the region of the model
    that has been captured.   The surrounding area gets a constant transform so
    remains intact.  Turning this off will extend the deformation globally.

    In particular, a global squash/stretch works best not limited to a region
    as the squishing will be performed uniformally rather than tapering off to
    the capture bounds.

Visualize Falloff:
    Controls the generation of the `vis_falloff` attribute.  This attribute stores where points lie on the capture range and by default is visualized.

=== Deformation ===

Bend Mode:
    The amount of bend can be given by either an angle, or by
    providing a direction that the original capture axis
    should end up in.
Bend:
    Angle in degrees to bend.  You can make this over 180 to bend
    something over itself multiple times.
Up Vector:
    The bend is always perpendicular to the capture axis, but this
    specifies what orientation it should use.
Goal Direction:
    The capture axis will be bent until it lines up with this direction.

Twist:
    Angle in degrees to rotate around the capture axis.  Can be over
    180 to twist multiple times int he interval.

Length Scale:
    The captured length will be squashed or stretched by
    this scale factor.

Preserve Volume:
    If scaling the length, a corresponding inverse scale will be
    performed on the other axes to roughly preserve volume.  Because
    this is applied smoothly, it is not an accurate volume preservation
    but is of the appropriate magnitude.

Taper Mode:
    When tapering from one scale to another, it can either be applied
    at a constant rate, making a linear taper, or be eased-in and
    eased-out to give a smoother connection.

Taper:
    The amount to scale the final transform by.

Squish:
    The center of the transform will be scaled by this amount.
    The amount of scale will be eased-in and eased-out from
    this total scale, letting you build bulges or pinches.

=== Capture ===

Capture Origin:
    The center of the source capture plane.
Capture Direction:
    The normal of the capture planes, and the direction pointing to the destination capture plane from the source.
Capture Length:
    Controls the region of space that receives the partial transforms.  Must be non-zero in length.
Guide Scale:
    Scale of the guide geometry so it can be made to better fit the model.

== Attributes ==

Use Rest Positions:
    If set, and there is a second input, it is used to determine how
    to capture geometry.  If there is no second input, and a `rest`
    point attribute is present, that attribute is used.  If there is
    no `rest` point attribute, a `rest` attribute is created and used.
    This ensures downstream Bend SOPs will operate on the undeformed
    geometry as expected.

    If clear, the point positions are used as is and no rest attributes
    will be created.  This is useful if using as a pure modeling tool.

Attributes to Transform:
    Point and Vertex attributes that match this pattern will be
    transformed.  Their Type Info will be used to determine how
    they should transform, as points, vectors, and normals
    all need different operations.

    If `P` matches this string, then primitive transforms will
    also be rotated.

Recompute Affected Normals:
    Recomputes any normals that are affected by polygons that use both
    transformed and untransformed points. When transforming the full
    geometry or full connected components, the results should be the same
    as when this option is off, i.e. the normals will just be transformed
    and not recomputed. This does nothing if `P` is not being transformed.

Preserve Normal Length:
    Normal lengths remain unaffected.

Step Size:
    A small step is taking in each direction to determine how the deformer is twisting space.  This must be small enough to pick up the key feature changes of your space, but not so small as to lead to numerical problems.  A good rule of thumb is half the inter-point spacing of your model.

@inputs
Geometry to Bend:
    Can be any geometry, including NURBS and Beziers, but should have sufficient points for a better deformation. 

Rest Geometry:
    If attached, this will be used to determine where points are in the capture range.  This is useful if stacking deformation operations and one doesn't want the capturing to change as a result of upstream operations.
