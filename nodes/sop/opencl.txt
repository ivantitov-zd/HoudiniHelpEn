"""Executes an OpenCL kernel on geometry."""

The OpenCL SOP provides a general interface to create and run OpenCL
kernels on geometry.  It allows binding of constants, attributes,
and volume data to OpenCL parameters in the kernel.

@parameters

== Kernel ==

Kernel Name:
    #id: kernelname
    
    The name of the OpenCL kernel to execute with the loaded program.
    
Use Code Snippet:
    #id: usecode
    Use the code provided in the Kernel Code parameter rather than an external disk file.  This makes for quicker editing and creation of OpenCL SOPs.
    
    
Kernel File:
    #id: kernelfile
    The path to OpenCL program file to compile. This can include a path to an on disk file or asset.
    
    
Kernel Code:
    #id: kernelcode

    The OpenCL kernel to execute when in Code Snippet mode.
    
    
Kernel Options:
    #id: kerneloptions
    Specify any desired compile flags for the kernel.

    NOTE:
        The Apple OSX OpenCL compiler requires only a single space between kernel options!
    
    
Use Write Back Kernel:
    #id: usewritebackkernel

    After the kernel is executed, a second kernel may be immediately
    executed with the same set of parameters bound to it.  You can avoid
    race conditions where multiple threads want to write to the same data
    by breaking it into a two-pass operation.
    
    
Write Back Kernel Name:
    #id: writebackkernelname

    The name of the kernel to use in the write back operation.  It
    will have the same function signature as the main operation.
    
    
Generate Kernel:
    #id: generatekernel
    Creates a prototype for the required kernel function taking all 
    of your current selected parameters into account.  This can be
    used as a starting point or to update your interface when
    new parameters are added or removed.
    
    
Recompile Kernel:
    #id: recompile
    When loading kernels from disk the kernel is cached to avoid
    regenerating it every solve.  Turning this on forces the re-loading
    and recompiling of the kernel.  This is useful if #include files
    refer to code that has changed, or the kernel file is changed
    in an external text editor.

    It should always be disabled when protoyping is complete.
    
    
== Options ==

Run Over:
    #id: runover
    
    The provided OpenCL kernel is invoked once.  The number of global ids,
    however, is controlled by this setting.  First Writeable attribute
    sets it to the size of the first bound attribute that is marked writeable.
    First Writeable Volume likewise sets it to the total voxels of the 
    first bound volume that is marked writeable.

    In workset mode, detail integer array attributes are used to determine
    the number of worksets and the sizes of them.

    NOTE:
        The global ids will be rounded up to ensure efficient processing on the GPU, so you should always compare the `get_global_id(0)` with the actual length of the bound attribute.

Iterations:
    #id: iterations

    The kernel can be re-executed a variable number of times.  This avoids
    having to use more nodes to create a for loop, and ensures all data
    remains on the video card during the successive evaluations.
    
Worksets Begin Attr.:
    #id: worksets_begin
    Detail integer array attribute specifying the start value of each
    workset.

Worksets Length Attr.:
    #id: worksets_length
    Detail integer array attribute specifying the length of each workset.
    The kernel will be invoked for each of these sizes.  Zero sizes
    will be skipped.

Finish Kernels:
    #id: finish
    
    When Finish Kernels is disabled, no attempt is to wait for the
    OpenCL kernels to complete before continuing the next solver.
    This lets them run in the background until their results
    are actually needed.  To simplify debugging, it is useful
    to ensure kernels are finished to make sure errors are detected
    in the right spot.

    
Include Time:
    #id: time
    
    Include the current time as a parameter.
    
Include Timestep:
    #id: timeinc
    Include the current timestep as a parameter. 
    
Timescale:
    #id: timescale

    A constant multiplier on the timestep.
    
    
Time Method:
    #id: timemethod
    
    For some operations you may wish to know the power of the timestep.
    Rather than recomputing in the kernel, you can set this to `e^Timestep`
    and have the exponentiation pre-computed.
    
Include Simplex Noise Data:
    #id: xnoise
    Include an opaque pointer that can be passed to the simplex noise
    functions in <xnoise.h> to generate simplex noise and curlnoise from
    OpenCL kernels.
    
    
== Bindings ==

=== OpenCL Parameters ===

Each parameter can either be a fixed constant value, evaluated
before kernel invocation, or read/write from a volume or
geometry attribute.

Parameter Name:
    #id: bindings#_name
    
    The name of the parameter.  This is used in the `Generate Kernel`
    button, but is otherwise only present as a comment.  The actual
    binding to an OpenCL kernel is done by parameter order, not
    by the name.
    
=== Options ===

Parameter Type:
    #id: bindings#_type
    
    The type of parameter to create and bind.

    Integer:
	A constant integer value, allowing you to bind channel references and expressions that are pre-computed.
        
    Float:
	A constant float value.  Optionally you can scale it by the timestep.
        
    Float Vec4:
	A constant tuple of four floats, binding to a `float4` OpenCL parameter.
        
    Ramp:
	A scalar ramp.  Because evaluating a spline-based ramp inside of an OpenCL kernel is complex, the ramp is instead sampled into a uniform
	array of floats.  The `Ramp Size` parameter controls the number of samples used.
        
    Attribute:
	Bind a geometry attribute.
        
    Volume:
	Bind a volume.
        
    
Integer:
    #id: bindings#_intval

    Integer value to use integer mode.
    
    
Float:
    #id: bindings#_fval
    
    Float value to use float mode.
    
Float 4:
    #id: bindings#_v4val

    Float 4 value to use float 4 mode.
    
    
Time Scale:
    #id: bindings#_timescale

    How to scale the provided float value by the timestep.  Because timeinc
    may not be known at time of parameter evaluation, it can be computed
    as a constant prior to evaluating the kernel and applied
    to the float value.
    
Ramp:
    #id: bindings#_ramp
	
    The ramp data to provide as a list of float values.
    
Ramp Size:
    #id: bindings#_rampsize

    The number of floating point values to evaluate the ramp in.
    
Volume:
    #id: bindings#_volume

    The name or number of the volume primitive to bind.
    
    
Force Alignment:
    #id: bindings#_forcealign
    
    To simplify kernels one may often assume all volumes are aligned
    in resolution and transform.  If Force Alignment is set, this is
    enforced and volumes that are misaligned generate errors.
    
    
Voxel Resolution:
    #id: bindings#_resolution

    Add the resolution of the volume as a parameter.
    
    
Voxel Size:
    #id: bindings#_voxelsize

    Add the size of the volume as a parameter, in SOP space.
    
    
Volume Transform to World:
    #id: bindings#_xformtoworld

    Add a matrix transform that converts from the volume's voxel coordinates
    to the SOP coordinates.
    
    
Volume Transform to Voxel:
    #id: bindings#_xformtovoxel
    
    Add a matrix transform that converts from SOP coordinates to the volume's voxel coordinates.
    
Attribute:
    #id: bindings#_attribute

    Which attribute to bind.  It is an error if it is missing, unless the optional flag is set.

    Present for Attributes.
    
Class:
    #id: bindings#_attribclass

    The type of the attribute.  Since the first writeable attribute can determine the iteration order, this can determine the number of global
    ids processed by the OpenCL solver.

    Not all bound attributes need to be the same type, or even come from the same geometry data.

    Present for Attributes.
    
Type:
    #id: bindings#_attribtype
    
    What sort of attribute to bind.  Float and integer attributes are bound as single arrays containing all element values in order.  Tuples are
    interleaved, ie, P will be bound as xyzxyzxyz.

    Array attributes are bound as two arrays.  One array contains the offsets of each element's array data.  Thus, the difference of
    a pair of offsets provides the elements array length.  The second array is the data of all elements' arrays concatenated into a single
    array.

    Present for Attributes.
    
Size:
    #id: bindings#_attribsize
    
    Tuple size of the attribute to bind.  If greater than zero, the attribute must be able to provide this tuple size.  If zero, it will bind
    automatically and an extra parameter will be generated storing the tuplesize.

    Present for Attributes.

    
Readable:
    #id: bindings#_readable
    
    Determines if the OpenCL kernel will read from this attribute or volume. If not set, the attributes values will not be copied onto the GPU.
    This is useful for write-only attributes as it avoids an unnecessary copy, but requires care as uninitialized data will be present.
    
Writeable:
    #id: bindings#_writeable
    
    Determines if the OpenCL kernel will write back to this attribute or volume.  Causes the CPU version of the attribute or volume to be
    marked out of date so the next time it is needed it will be copied back from the GPU.

    
Optional:
    #id: bindings#_optional

    Marks the attribute or volume as not necessary.  If the attribute or volume isn't present in the geometry, rather than erroring, a #define is set in the kernel
    options to disable the attribute.  Note that this also changes the parameter signature, so the __Generate Code__ button should be used
    to verify the syntax.

    NOTE:
        The parameter name is used in the `#define`, so changing the parameter name requires changing the code.
