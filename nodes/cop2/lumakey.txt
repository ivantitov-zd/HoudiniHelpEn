"""Keys the image based on luminance (or similar function)."""

This operation keys the image based on luminance (or similar function).
It has a lower and upper bound, which may be both active at once. A
pixel is keyed if it lies between the lower and upper bounds. If either
bound is disabled, the pixel only needs to satisfy the other bound
constraint (either be less than the Maximum Luminance, or greater than
the Minimum).

The key is done on one of the input planes, and applied to all scoped
planes. One of many luminance functions is applied to the input pixels,
and the luminance value is compared to the bounds. The output plane is
then multiplied by the computed key value.

A rolloff area may be used to soften the transition across the bound.
An interpolation function is used to ramp down to black. The rolloff
area begins at the Min or Max Luminance, and ends at a value greater
than the Max Luminance or less than the Minimum Luminance, at a distance
determined by the Rolloff parameter.

For sharp bound cutoffs, Super Sampling is used to antialias the edges.
Multiple bilinear samples are run through the keyer to determine the
final key value. To perform no supersampling, set Super Sample to 1.
Super Sampling increases cook time exponentially, so while a value of 3
samples 9 subpixels, 8 samples 64. It is wise to keep the value of the
Super Sample parameter under 5 unless you need extremely high quality
edges.

@parameters

    == LumaKey ==

        Min Luminance:
            #channels: /minval

            If on, this sets the lower limit for the key.
        Max Luminance:
            #channels: /maxval

            If on, this sets the upper limit for the key.
        Discard Keyed Region:
            If on, the keyed region is discarded.
        Rolloff Region:
            #channels: /rolloff

            The size of the rolloff region, in case a sharp edge is not
            wanted. This extends the keyed range by the rolloff size
            with a soft function.
        Rolloff Function:
            Specifies the rolloff function of the rolloff region.
        Luminance Function:
            Specifies how to prep the color to key off.
        Supersample:
            #channels: /subsample

            The number of subpixels sampled per pixel in one direction
            (2 samples 4 pixels, 3 samples 9 pixels). More subsamples
            produce finer edges, at the cost of performance.
        Key Plane:
            Specifies the plane to key. All scoped planes will be masked
            based on the result of the lumakey on this plane.
        Add Alpha if Missing:
            If no alpha plane exists in the input, add it and fill it with the
            keying mask.
