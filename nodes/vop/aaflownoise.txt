"""Generates anti-aliased (fractional brownian motion) noise by using
the derivative information of the incoming position to compute
band-limited noise."""

This operator generates anti-aliased (fractional brownian motion) noise
by using the derivative information of the incoming position to compute
band-limited noise. This type of noise is ideal for shading.

This operator is very similar to the Anti-Aliased Noise but adds some
extra options to deal with flownoise.

Flow is your position in flowspace.  This can be thought of as an
extra dimension to your noise, but has a fixed period of 1.  Unlike
normal approaches to adding another dimension, it operates by rotating
the noise vectors, thereby resulting in a flow-like behavior rather
than dimension slicing-like behavior.

Flow rate is analogous to roughness, but applied to the flow
dimension.  Values greater than 1 appear like turbulence where higher
frequencies spin faster than lower frequencies.  Values less than one
make the finer detail appear to float on the surface of the
low-frequency flow.

The advection term enables backward-tracing of the noise on each
successive frequency.  This helps the higher frequency noise to stick
with the low-frequency flow, but is much more expensive.

The roughness parameter determines the coarseness of the noise. The
maxoctaves parameter limits the noise to a fixed number of iterations.

The noise generated is centered at 0 and typically has values between
-0.5 and +0.5.

Make sure at least the Position (`pos`) input is connected in order to
notice any noise. The easiest way to accomplish this is to pipe the
global variable `P` into the `pos` input. However, the global variable
is in camera space, so noise will move through the surface.

To fix this use the [Rest Position VOP|Node:vop/restpos] (for deforming geometry) or
simply transform the position to object space using the [Transform VOP|Node:vop/transform].

Connect the noise output to the Color Mix bias or to Displace Along
Normal to obtain interesting results. The options are boundless.
