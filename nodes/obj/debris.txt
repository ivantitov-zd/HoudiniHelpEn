"""Emits particles from the edges of separating fractured rigid bodies."""

This tool is used to emit particles from fractured rigid body objects as they separate from each other. The emission can be controlled by altering the type of entity they are emitted from, as well as the minimum and maximum distances which determine when pieces become separated, and the amount of separation that can occur before they are considered completely separated and should stop emitting. The duration controls the maximum amount an area will emit for.

@parameters
    Minimum Distance:
	The minimum distance at which two objects are considered to be separated.
    Maximum Distance:
	The maximum distance at which two objects are considered to be fully
	separated and to cease emitting particles.
    Emission Duration:
	The maximum number of frames which an area will emit for.
    Emission Type:
    	Specify how particles are generated.

	Edges:
	    Particles are generated from the edges of separating objects.
	Faces:
	    Particles are generated from the interior faces of separating objects.
    Birth Method:
	Control how many particles are generated.

	Automatic:
	    The number of particles is specified by the number of valid points 
	    on the emit surface.
	User Defined:
	    Specify the number of particles emitted per frame.
    Rate Multiplier:
	Multiply the number of points in the base surface group.
    Birth Rate:
	Specify the number of particles emitted per frame.
