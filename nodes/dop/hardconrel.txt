= Hard Constraint Relationship =

""" Defines a constraint relationship that must always be satisfied."""

The Hard Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint
relationship data types. These constraint relationships are attached as
subdata to a [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to control the
relationship between the Anchor nodes attached to the Constraint.

Hard Constraint Relationship DOPs are already built into high level
assets such as the [RBD Pin Constraint|Node:dop/rbdpinconstraint],
so it is
usually not necessary to deal with them directly. Further, both the Hard
Constraint Relationship DOP and the [Spring Constraint
Relationship|Node:dop/springconrel] are built into the [Constraint
Relationship DOP|Node:dop/conrelationship].

Solvers are expected to ensure that the Anchors of a Hard Constraint
Relationship always evaluate to the same value.


@parameters

== Data Options ==

=== Bullet Data ===
The following parameters are used by the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

Rest Length:
    This parameter allows the relationship to be satisfied when the
    Anchors are separated by a non-zero distance. 
    
    If this value is non-zero, then the Anchor values will actually
    be pushed apart in an attempt to maintain the specified rest
    length between them.

== Guide Options ==
Radius:
    #channels: /rad

    Indicates the radius of the sphere that appears at the
    constraint anchor positions in the viewport as guide geometry.
    Whether or not to display the guide geometry depends on the
    [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to which this relationship
    is attached.
Color:
    #channels: /colorr /colorg /colorb

    Controls the color of the constraint guide geometry.
Show Object Link:
    This parameter controls the display of guide geometry
    connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
