= Constraint Network =

"""Constrains pairs of RBD objects together according to a polygon network."""

NOTE:
    This DOP is currently only supported by the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver]
    and the [Wire Solver|Node:dop/wiresolver].

The constraint network defines pairs of RBD objects that should be constrained
together.

With the constraint network, SOP Geometry is specified which defines what
objects should be constrained. This makes it easy to procedurally generate a
set of constraint relationships, including constraints of different types. Each
point in the geometry represents a constraint anchor, according to the `name`
and `P` attributes. Each two-point polygon represents a constraint, according
to the constraint data specified by the `constraint_name` attribute.

TIP:
        Advanced users can use the `constraint_name` and `constraint_type`
        attributes to dynamically change constraint types with animation or a
        [SOP Solver|Node:dop/sopsolver].

== Breaking Constraints == (breaking)

If a constraint is broken by a solver (such as when sufficient force is applied
to break a glue bond), the primitive will be placed into a primitive group
named `broken`. That primitive group can be used in a [SOP Solver|Node:dop/sopsolver]
to trigger events such as emitting debris when a constraint breaks. Any
constraints that are in the `broken` primitive group will be ignored by solvers
on subsequent frames. Currently, only glue constraints will be broken by the
[Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

Constraints can also be broken by using a SOP Solver to delete primitives from
the constraint network's geometry. For linear constraints, the `force` and
`distance` primitive attributes are updated by the solver to contain the force
applied to satisfy the constraint and the distance between the anchors,
respectively. For angular constraints, the `torque` and `angle` primitive
attributes are updated by the solver to contain the torque applied to satisfy
the constraint and the angle (in radians) between the anchors. For [glue
constraints|Node:dop/glueconrel], the `impact` primitive attribute is updated
by the solver to contain the accumulated impulses for the glue bond. These
attributes can be used to remove a constraint when certain conditions are met.

== Anchor Types == (anchortypes)
Each point in the constraint geometry represents an anchor. All constraints are
made up of two anchors.  Currently there are 4 different types of anchors,
specified by the `name`, `anchor_type` and `anchor_id` point attributes.

A World Space Anchor is an anchor that is simply placed at a static world space
position, specified by the `P` attribute on the anchor. If an anchor has an
empty value for the `name` attribute, then the anchor is treated as a World
Space Anchor. If the `name` attribute specifies an invalid name, the constraint
is skipped.

A Relative Offset Anchor is an anchor that is placed at specific position
relative to a simulated object. This position is fixed to the object's initial
rotation, so if the object is rotated during the simulation the anchor rotates
with it. If the `name` attribute specifies a valid object, and the `anchor_id`
attribute is set to `-1` (or is not defined), then the anchor is treated as a
Relative Offset Anchor, with the `P` attribute specifying the offset from the
object's centroid.

A Point Anchor is an anchor whose position is bound to that of a certain point
on the geometry of a simulated object. When the `name` attribute is valid and
the `anchor_id` attribute is a valid point index, then the anchor will be
placed at the specified point. Alternatively, if the `anchor_type` attribute is
set to `vertex` (the default is `point`) then the anchor will be placed at the
point referred to by the vertex with the index in `anchor_id`.

NOTE:
    In cases where the geometry of a simulated object changes over the course
    of a simulation, anchoring to a point by specifying a point (or vertex)
    index in the `anchor_id` attribute may not yield correct results. This is
    because as the geometry changes, point and vertex indices may also change,
    meaning the Point Anchors could end up referring to different points than
    at the beginning of the simulation.

    To fix this, add the integer point attribute `anchor_pid` or the integer
    vertex attribute `anchor_vid` to the simulated object whose geometry may
    change. If either of these attributes exist, then the `anchor_id` specified
    on the anchor will match to the first point (or vertex) with the same
    `anchor_pid` (or `anchor_vid`) value on the simulated geometry. This way as
    the geometry changes, the attributes will stay the same.

An Agent Anchor is an anchor that is attached to a transform in an agent's rig.
The transform does not need to be associated with a simulated object (i.e. the agent's collision layer does not need to have a shape attached to the transform).
When the `anchor_type` is `agent` and the `name` attribute references an agent's transform (e.g. `agent1/head`), the `local_P` and `local_orient` attributes can be used to specify the local transform of the anchor.

== Attributes == (attributes)

[Include:standard_constraintnetworkattribs]

NOTE:
        For [RBD Packed Objects|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject], the name point attribute from the DOP object’s geometry is used to identify which object to attach the constraint to. Since multiple [RBD Packed Objects|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] may contain packed primitives with the same names, the identifier can optionally be prefixed by the DOP Object name (e.g. `object2/piece3`) to avoid name conflicts and uniquely identify the object. For all other types of objects, the DOP object name is used as the identifier.

        When switching a setup from using an [RBD Packed Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] to an [RBD Fractured Object|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject], ensure that the anchor names are not prefixed with the DOP Object name so that the constraint network is compatible with both object representations.

@parameters

== Data Options ==

Geometry Source:
    Specifies the source of the constraint network geometry.

    SOP:
        Use the SOP specified by the __SOP Path__ parameter.
    First Context Geometry:
        Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's first input.
    Second Context Geometry:
        Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's second input.
    Third Context Geometry:
        Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's third input.
    Fourth Context Geometry:
        Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's fourth input.

SOP Path:
    The SOP geometry to use to determine the constraints.

Use Object Transform:
    Turn on this option to embed the transform from the parent object of the
    SOP along with the geometry.   

Overwrite with SOP:
    This flag will re-import the network whenever it is set, allowing a
    completely animated constraint behavior.

== Guide Options ==

    Show Guide Geometry:
        Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in
        the viewport representing this constraint.

    Show Object Link:
        This parameter controls the display of guide geometry
        connecting the constraint to the constrained object.

== Relationship ==
    Attach Internal Constraints to Object:
        The default behavior is to attach the constraint geometry to a [relationship|Node:dop/applyrel] between the objects, which allows constraints to be anchored to multiple DOP objects.
        If constraints only need to be between packed primitives in a single DOP object, this option allows the constraint geometry to be attached to the DOP object's `ConstraintGeometry` subdata instead of a relationship.
        In this mode, constraints can be modified during the timestep with a SOP solver that processes the object's `ConstraintGeometry` subdata (for relationships, any attached solvers are run at the beginning of the timestep before solving any objects).
    Constrained Objects:
        Specifies the affected DOP objects in the created relationship.
    Relationship Name:
        A unique name that will identify the relationship.

[Include:standard_dataactive_parms]

@inputs

Objects To Be Processed:
    The objects to apply this relationship to, that will be eligible for
    being constrained by the object name attribute.
Constraints To Create:
    The constraints that can be created using the primitives in the SOP
    geometry.
Constraint Solvers:
    SOP solvers may be attached to update the constraint network
    dynamically in response to events. Only a single geometry is shared by
    all the objects, so this solver is executed once per relationship, not
    per object.
