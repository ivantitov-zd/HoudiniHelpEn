"""Runs a VEX snippet to modify voxel values in a volume."""

== Overview ==

This is a very powerful, low-level node that lets experts who are
familiar with VEX tweak voxel values using code.

This node corresponds to the [Volume VOP SOP|Node:sop/volumevop],
but uses a textual VEX snippet instead of a VOP network.

WARNING:
    This node requires that you understand the [vex language|/vex/].
    It is very easy to write incorrect code using this node.

This node runs the snippet _on every voxel in the input volume(s)_
(unless the __Bind each volume to density__ parameter is on).
The snippet can edit the input geometry by changing attributes.
It can access information from other geometry using attributes and VEX functions.

* Press ((MMB)) on the node to see any error output from the snippet.

* You can use the VEX function `ch` to evaluate parameters.
  The path is relative to this node (`ch("parm")` will evaluate the parameter `parm` on this node).
  This evaluation will be done at the current time.

* Unlike the [Volume Mix SOP|Node:sop/volumemix], this does not use local variables.
  Further, all backtick expressions and `$F` variables will be evaluated at frame 1,
  not the current time.
  Use `Frame`, `Time`, or `TimeInc` instead.

== Reading and modifying the voxel value == (values)

The current voxel value in a volume is available as `@<<volume_name>>`.
You can read this variable to get the current value, and assign it to change the value.
For example, to add `0.1` to the value of every voxel in the float volume `foo`:

{{{
#!vex
@foo += 0.1
}}}

If a volume does not have a name, it will automatically be bound to `@density`.

If you have multiple named volumes in the input, you can write a single snippet
that modifies the different volumes in different ways, for example:

{{{
#!vex
@foo += 0.1
@bar += 0.2
@baz += 0.3
}}}

Alternatively, you can turn on __Bind each volume to density__.
This acts as if every input volume was named `density`,
so you can use the same snippet to modify every voxel in every volume:

{{{
#!vex
// Modify @foo, @bar, and @baz in the same way
// (when Bind each volume to density is on)
@density += sin(@P.x)
}}}

NOTE:
    Unlike how the
    [Point Wrangle|Node:sop/pointwrangle]
    and [Attribute Wrangle|Node:sop/attribwrangle] nodes work,
    writing to an unknown `@<<name>>` variable will not create a volume.

== VEX variables ==

You can create temporary variables.
For example, the following code reads an offset location from a point.

{{{
#!vex
vector temp = @P;
temp += {0.1, 0.2, 0.3};
@density = volumesample(@OpInput1, 0, temp);
}}}

== Bound Variables ==

A number of variables are bound in the Volume VOP context. 
Use the `@` prefix syntax to access them.

`P`:
	Location of the current voxel's center.
`ix`, `iy`, `iz`:
	The integer index of the current voxel.  With VDBs, this can be
	negative.
`resx`, `resy`, `resz`:
	The resolution of the current volume primitive.  For VDBs this
	is the size of the active voxel region.
`dPdx`, `dPdy`, `dPdz`:
	Vectors giving the length and orientation of the x, y, and z edges of
	the 0th voxel.
`center`:
	The center of the volume in SOP space.
`Time`:
	Current time in seconds.
`Frame`:
	Current time in frames.
`TimeInc`:
	Time increment between frames, in seconds.
`OpInput1`, `OpInput2`, `OpInput3`, `OpInput4`:
	A string that can be used to refer to the corresponding input
	of this SOP in vex operations that take file parameters.

@parameters

== Code ==

Group:
    Only run the program on these volumes in the input geometry.
    Leave this blank to modify all volumes in the input.
    
    (See [reading and writing voxel values|#values] above.)

Bind Each to Density:
    Changes how the node applies the snippet.
    When this is off, you must refer to specific volumes in the input by name (for example `@foo`).
    When this is on, every input volume is treated as `@density`,
    so you can write one snippet to affect every input volume regardless of their names.
    
    (See [reading and writing voxel values|#values] above.)
    
[Include:pointwrangle#snippet]

Volumes To Write To:
    Only modify volumes if their names match this pattern.
    The default pattern allows any volume to be modified.
    You can speed up the node by only listing volumes that are _actually_ modified by the snippet.
    
    For example, in the following snippet, only the `density` volume is modified.
    The `temperature` volume is not modified, only read.
    
    {{{
    #!vex
    @density = @temperature;
    }}}
    
    However, for obscure reasons, the node will both modify `density` and _copy_ `temperature`.
    This uses time and memory.
    To prevent this, you could set this parameter to `density` to prevent the node
    from copying `temperature`.
    Of course, this requires that you explicitly manage the list of writable volumes.

Enforce Prototypes:
    Automatic binding with the `@` syntax can be convenient, but if your
    system becomes more complex there is the risk that a typo in an `@` binding
    will silently just bind a non-existent attribute.

    This option forces all `@` bindings to be explicitly declared as
    prototypes before use.

== Bindings ==

    Autobind by Name:
	Will use the name primitive attribute to determine which
	volume binds with which parameter.  If the name attribute
	isn't present, the first volume is bound to density.

	A name like "foo" will be bound to the float parameter
	"foo".  A name of "foo.x" will be bound to the x
	component of the vector (three float) parameter "foo".  A
	name like "foo.zx" will be bound to the x,z component of
	the matrix (three by three) parameter "foo".
    
    Primitive, Primitive Name, VEX Parameter:
	Manually specifies the bindings of each primitive.  This
	is equivalent to those primitives having a name attribute
	with the given name.  If Primitive Name is not empty,
	the primitive with the matching name will be bound to the
	given vex parameter.

    Only Output Created Geometry:
	Don't output any of the incoming volumes.  Instead, the output
	will consiste of only geometry created by the VOPs.  This
	is useful if generating points from volumes.  Note you will
	still have to do a dummy write to any volume you wish
	to iterate over.

    Evaluation Node Path:
	VEX functions like `ch()` usually evaluate with respect to this node.
	Providing a path here can override where the path search starts
	from.  This is useful for embedding in a digital asset where you
	would like the top level digital asset to be the search root.

    Export Parameters:
	This pattern can be used to override
	the export option on the VEX shader to avoid writing to 
	certain volumes.  The pattern matches the VEX parameter, not
	the bound volume.  The volume will still be bound for
	reading.
