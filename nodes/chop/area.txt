"""Calculates the area under a channel's graph, which is the same as calculating the integral of a channel, or integrating the channel."""

This CHOP calculates the area under a channel's graph, which is the same as calculating the "integral" of a channel, or "integrating" the channel.

It uses the graph of each input channel and calculates the area between the graph and the horizontal 0-value line. It finds the area between a __Start__ and __End__ index, which is by default the entire chop range.

The area is calculated by adding the channel values for every sample, starting with the sample at the Start index. Negative values reduce the area. The area is converted to the Units by dividing by samples per Unit. The cumulative values are put in the output channels.

This CHOP is particularly useful for calculating a point's position from its velocity (speed) or acceleration. If the input is a velocity, a __First Order__ integral will return the position. If the input is an acceleration, a __Second Order__ integral will return the position, and a
__First Order__ integral will return the velocity.

The first input contains the channels to be integrated.

The second input is used to reset the area to zero. At samples where the second input is zero or less, the area is reset to zero. A [Wave CHOP|node:chop/wave] passed into the second input causes the Area to be zero for half a cycle.

The third input is an optional start/end reference. If connected, it
will override the parameters in the Range page and integrate the first
input's channels between the start and end of the reference input.
