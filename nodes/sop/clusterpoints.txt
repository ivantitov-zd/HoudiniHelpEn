"""Higher-level node to cluster points based on their positions (or any vector attribute)."""

== Overview ==

This is a higher-level node that can output clustered points with a cluster attribute and optionally cluster center points. For the lower-level clustering node this node is based on, see the [Cluster node|Node:sop/cluster].

This node creates a `cluster` integer attribute on the points which indicates the cluster number the point belongs to (all points in the same cluster will have the same `cluster` value).

This node uses the [K-means clustering algorithm|Wp:K-means] to group the points.

@inputs

Points to cluster:
    The input points to sort into clusters. This node will create an attribute (by default called `cluster`) on each point containing the cluster number the point belongs to.
    
Rest Position:
    Calculate the cluster centers based on the points in this input instead of the points to cluster. This is useful for calculating the cluster centers from a decimated point cloud (for performance) or from the point positions at a different frame (using the [Timeshift node|Node:sop/timeshift]).

@parameters

Output Attribute:
    #id: attrib_name
    #contentfrom: cluster#cluster_attrib
    
Output:
    Whether to output clustered points, cluster centers with `scale` attribute, both clustered points and cluster centers in groups, or the bounding boxes of the clusters.
    
    Cluster points:
        Output the input points with a cluster attribute on each point containing the cluster number the point belongs to.
    
    Average points:
        Output the cluster centers as points. The points have a `scale` vector attribute describing the bounding box of the points in the cluster.
    
    Both:
        Outputs both the clustered input points (in a group named `clusterpoints`) and the cluster center points (in a group named `averagepoints`).
    
    Boxes:
        Outputs bounding boxes for the clusters.

Color Output:
    Add random color (`Cd`) attributes to cluster of points.

    Points:
	Do not color the points.
    Colored Particles:
	Color the points by cluster and create a particle system out of them.
	This option is for backwards compatibility with versions where
	points were only displayed when in particle systems.
    Colored Points:
	Color the points by cluster.

Cluster Filter:
    Only outputs clusters where the cluster number matches this pattern. For example, setting this to `3 4` will only output the points in clusters 3 and 4.
    
    The pattern can use the same [pattern matching syntax|/model/groups#manual] as other surface nodes that let you specify point/primitive numbers. For example, `3-6` will output clusters 3, 4, 5, and 6.

== Cluster settings ==

Build Clusters:
    If the incoming geometry already has a point attribute with the specified
    output name, you can skip cluster building and just use it.  This allows you to take advantage of the other options for setting up cluster simulations.

== Averaging settings ==

Copy point attributes from cluster:
    The average points representing the clusters will have the attributes
    of the cluster points attribute transferred onto them.

Max Sample Count:
    The number of nearest points to contribute to the point attribute
    of the center.  A value of 1 will just use the closest point.

Size Attribute name:
    When __Output__ is "Average points" or "Both", the node adds a vector attribute with this name to the cluster center points, describing the bounding box of the points in the cluster. The default is `scale`.

Padding min:
    #id: size_padding

    Amount of padding to add to the negative X, negative Y, and negative Z sides of bounding boxes and/or the `scale` attribute on cluster center points.

Padding max:
    #id: size_padding2
    
    Amount of padding to add to the positive X, positive Y, and positive Z sides of bounding boxes and/or the `scale` attribute on cluster center points.
