"""Creates a sky filled with volumentric clouds"""

This tool will take a bounding box and generate procedural clouds inside. The effect is done at render time but can be visualized in viewport at lower resolution/subdivision level.

[Image:opdef:.?sky.jpg]

NOTE:
    The output of this SOP is different when rendering versus interactive.
    Because it usually is coupled with the CVEX shader, when rendered it
    outputs an empty geometry.  To have a ROP Geometry extract the display
    geometry, reference the virtual __display_sop__ child node.

NOTE:
    The VDB controls only change the detail level in viewport.  Since the effect is generated at render time, __Volume Step Rate__ parameter on the [Mantra ROP|Node:out/ifd] is the main control used to decided how fine the step size is for the volume. For a bounding box that might be in thousands of units, this value might need to be increased. A __Volume Step Rate__ of 1 for procedural CVEX shaders represents 10% of the size.

TIP:
    Set the input bounding box size before adjusting the parameters since they are dependent on the world scale of the box. If the size is thousands of units make sure to adjust the voxel size.

TIP:
    The sky can be 'baked' out into an environment map for fast renders. Use a camera with projection set to Polar (panoramic) to render an image that can be used as an environment map.

@parameters

Input:
    Bounding box for the sky.

== VDB ==
Preview Region:
        Bounding Box:
            Generates the clouds inside the bounding box.
        Camera Frustum:
            Generates clouds inside a user specified camera frustum.
Voxel Size:
        Size of the voxels to be used for preview. This is visible when __Preview Region__ is __Bounding Box__.
Camera Path:
        Path to the camera to be used for the viewing frustum volume. This is visible when __Preview Region__ is __Camera Frustum__.
Z Near:
        Near clipping plane distance for the camera. This is visible when __Preview Region__ is __Camera Frustum__.
Z Far:
        Far clipping plane distance for the camera. This is visible when __Preview Region__ is __Camera Frustum__.
Uniform Sampling:
        Specifies the voxel size to be used in the frustum. This is visible when __Preview Region__ is __Camera Frustum__.
            
== Density ==

Density Multiplier:
        Overall density multiplier.
Density Ramp:
        Allows remapping of the density field.
Coverage:
        Determines the amount of clouds generated.

        TIP:
                Adjust the Coverage in combination with the Noise Amplitude to get different looks.

Profile Warp:
        Allows vertical deformation of the generated sky relative to the bounding box center. Useful in shifting distant clouds to meet horizon lines.
        
== Noise ==

Noise Amplitude:
        Strength of the noise which is used in displacing the volume. Default value is for 1 unit cube, when increasing the bounding box into thousands of units this value should be adjusted as well.
Noise Element Scale:
        XYZ size of the noise generated, allows for stretching in a specific axis
Noise Element Size:
        Overall size of the noise features.
Noise Type:
        Different noise types to allow.
Roughness:   
        This sharpens or softens the edges of the noise.
Smooth Valleys:
        This will clear the noise from the low value areas.
Abs Noise:
        When on this will create absolute noise where each iteration is always positive in value. Turning it off will results in positive and negative values. 
Noise Offset:
        Changes the world space position used by the noise. This can be animated to create noise movement.
Noise Octaves:
        Number of noise iterations to be used. This controls the amount of detail in the noise.
Mirror:
        Mirrors the volume on vertical axis.
Top Scale:
        Allows scaling effect on the generated clouds in the positive Y axis direction
Bottom Scale: 
        Allows scaling effect on the generated clouds in the negative Y axis direction (useful in flattening the bottom of the clouds).
             
== Advection == 

Advect Amplitude:
        Amplitude of additional noise offset to the main noise to create finer details.
Advect Element Scale:
        Per-axis scaling of the noise pattern.  
Advect Element Size:
        The size of the noise pattern.
Advect Octaves:
        Number of noise iterations to be used. This controls the amount of detail in the noise.
Advect Offset:     
        Position offset of the secondary noise. This can be animated to create noise movement.
Advect Roughness:
        This sharpens or softens the edges of the secondary noise.
Advect Pulse Length:
        Size of the 4th component (time) in the advect noise.
Advect Flow:
        Flow is your position in flowspace. This can be thought of as an extra dimension to your noise, but has a fixed period of 1. Unlike normal approaches to adding another dimension, it operates by rotating the noise vectors, thereby resulting in a flow-like behavior rather than dimension slicing-like behavior.
Advect Flow Rate:
        Flow rate is analogous to roughness, but applied to the flow dimension. Values greater than 1 appear like turbulence where higher frequencies spin faster than lower frequencies. Values less than one make the finer detail appear to float on the surface of the low-frequency flow.
Self-Advection:
        The advection term enables backward-tracing of the noise on each successive frequency. This helps the higher frequency noise to stick with the low-frequency flow, but is much more expensive.
Time:        
        Animates the advect noise based on this parameter.
