"""A 4x4 matrix of floating point values."""

4x4 matrices are typically used in Houdini to represent a 3D transformation
(e.g. some combination of rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation).  A
single matrix compactly represents a transformation, and is much easier to deal
with than multiple translate, rotate, scale, shear, transformation order, and
rotation order values.

Note that Houdini's matrices are stored in row-major format, and vectors that
are multiplied with matrices are treated as row vectors.  So, if `p` is a
[Hom:hou.Vector4] representing a point and `M` is a Matrix4, you write
`p*M`, *not* `M*p`.  Similarly, `p*M1*M2` will first transform
`p` by `M1`, and then transform it by `M2`.

NOTE:
    Most mathematical notations treat vectors and points as column vectors
    instead of row vectors.  They will often use `A*B*C` (or simply `ABC`) to
    refer to a combined transform that first applies `C`'s transform, then
    `B`'s, and then applies `A`'s. However, the convention is different in
    Houdini. To represent the equivalent matrix expression in Houdini, you need
    to concatenate the transforms in the reverse order.  So, you would instead
    write `C'*B'*A'`, where `C'`, `B'`, `A'` are the transpose of C, B, A
    respectively.

You can multiply Vector3s or Vector4s by Matrix4s.  If you multiply a
Vector3, it is the same as multiplying a Vector4 where the fourth component
is 1 (see [Hom:hou.Vector3#__mul__]).

To transform a normal (as opposed to a point or vector), you need to multiply by
the inverse transpose of the matrix.  For example, suppose:

`p`:
    is a [Hom:hou.Vector3] object representing a position (or a
    [Hom:hou.Vector4] with `v[4]==1`)
`v`:
    is a [Hom:hou.Vector4] object representing a vector (a direction with a
    length but no fixed location in space), with `v[3]==0`
`n`:
    is a [Hom:hou.Vector4] object representing a normal, with `v[3]==0`
`m`:
    is a Matrix4 object representing a transform matrix

Then you would write:

{{{
#!python
p * m # to transform the point
v * m # to transform the vector
n * m.inverted().transposed() # to transform the normal
# (note that m.inverted().transposed() is mathematically equivalent to m.transposed().inverted())
}}}

Here is a concrete example:

{{{
#!pycon
>>> m = hou.hmath.buildTranslate((1, 1, 2))
>>> m
<hou.Matrix4 [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 2, 1]]>
>>> p = hou.Vector3(1, 2, 3)
>>> p * m
<hou.Vector3 [2, 3, 5]>
}}}

Both VEX and the UT_DMatrix4 class in the Houdini Development Kit (HDK) also
store matrices in row-major format.

@methods

::`__init__(self, values)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::HOM_Matrix4
    #replaces: Exp:matrix
    Return a new Matrix4.  You can pass no parameters (the result will contain
    all zeros), a float (the result's diagonal values will contain that float
    and the rest is all zeros), a sequence of 16 floats, a sequence of
    sequences of 4 floats, or a [Hom:hou.Matrix3].

    Note that Houdini's matrices are stored in row-major order, so the matrix's
    contents are grouped by row.

::`at(self, row, col)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::at
    Return the value of the matrix at the given row and column.

    Raises IndexError if the row or column are not between 0 and 3, inclusive.
    Note that negative indices will not index from the end.

::`setAt(self, row, col, value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::setAt
    Set the value of the matrix at the given row and column.

    Raises IndexError if the row or column are not between 0 and 3, inclusive.
    Note that negative indices will not index from the end.

::`asTuple(self)` -> `tuple` of `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::asTuple
    Return the contents of the matrix as a tuple of 16 floats.

::`asTupleOfTuples(self)` -> `tuple` of `tuple` of `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::asTupleOfTuples
    Return the contents of the matrix as a tuple of tuples of 4 floats.

::`setTo(self, sequence)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::setTo
    Set this matrix's contents.  The sequence may contain either 16 floats
    or 4 sequences, each with 4 floats.

    See [Hom:hou.Matrix4#__init__] for examples of suitable parameter values.

::`setToIdentity(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::setToIdentity
    #replaces: Exp:identity
    Set this matrix to the multiplicative identity, having 1's in the diagonal.

    The matrix will contain the values
    `[[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]`.  Note that
    you can construct a new matrix with these values using
    [Hom:hou.hmath#identityTransform] or `hou.Matrix4(1)`.

::`setToZero(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::setToZero
    #replaces: Exp:mzero
    Set this matrix to contain all zeros.

    Note that you can construct a new matrix with all zeros with
    `hou.Matrix4()`.

::`__add__(self, matrix4)` -> [Hom:hou.Matrix4]:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::__add__
    Add two matrices by adding corresponding entries together and return a new
    matrix.  This method lets you write `m1 + m2`, where `m1` and `m2` are
    Matrix4 objects.

::`__sub__(self, matrix4)` -> [Hom:hou.Matrix4]:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::__sub__
    Subtract another matrix from this one, subtracting corresponding entries,
    and return a new matrix.  This method lets you write `m1 - m2`, where `m1`
    and `m2` are Matrix4 objects.

::`__mul__(self, matrix4_or_scalar)` -> [Hom:hou.Matrix4]:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::__mul__
    Multiply this matrix by another matrix or by a scalar, returning a new
    matrix.  This method lets you write `m1 * m2`, where `m1` and `m2` are
    Matrix4 objects, or `m1 * s`, where `s` is a float.

    If `m1` and `m2` are transformation matrices and `v` is a vector,
    `v * m1 * m2` will transform `v` by `m1`, and then transform it by `m2`.
    This ordering occurs because Houdini's Matrices are stored in row-major
    format, and is opposite from the ordering used in traditional mathematical
    notation.  Note that `m1 * v` is not a valid expression in Houdini
    
    See the Matrix4 class documentation and [Hom:hou.Vector3#__mul__] for
    more information.  See [Wikipedia's matrix multiplication
    page|Wp:Matrix_multiplication] for details on
    how each element in the result is computed.

::`preMult(self, matrix4)` -> [Hom:hou.Matrix4]:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::preMult
    Returns `matrix4 * self`.  Note that `__mul__` returns `self * matrix4`,
    which is a different result because matrix multiplication is not
    commutative.

::`determinant(self)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::determinant
    #replaces: Exp:determinant
    Return the determinant of the matrix.

    See [Wikipedia's determinant page|Wp:Determinant].

::`explode(self, transform_order='srt', rotate_order='xyz', pivot=hou.Vector3(), pivot_rotate=hou.Vector3())` -> `dict` of `str` to [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Matrix4::explode
    #replaces: Exp:explodematrix, vorigin
    Return a dictionary with keys `'rotate'`, `'scale'`, `'translate'`, and
    `'shear'` whose values are [Hom:hou.Vector3] objects.  When applied in the
    specified order, the corresponding rotations, scales (and shears), and
    translations will give this matrix.

    The rotation is returned as a set of Euler angles, in degrees.  See
    [Wikipedia's Euler angles
    page|Wp:Euler_angles] for more information.

    transform_order:
	A string containing a permutation of the letters `s`, `r`, and `t`.
	The rotate, scale, and translate results are dependent on the order in
	which you perform those operations, and this string specifies that
	order.

	For example, imagine a transformation where you first translate in x
	by one unit, then you rotate in z by 45 degrees.  With a transform
	order of `'trs'` (translate, rotate, scale), the translate component
	is (1, 0, 0).  However, this same transformation could be constructed,
	for example, by first scaling, then rotating, and then translating.
	For this transformation order, the translate component would be
	`(1.0 / math.sqrt(2), 1.0 / math.sqrt(2), 0)`.

    rotate_order:
	A string containing a permutation of the letters `x`, `y`, and `z`
	that determines the order in which rotations are performed about
	the coordinate axes.

    pivot:
	A Vector3 containing a position about which rotations and scales are
	performed.  By default, this parameter is set to the origin.

    pivot_rotate:
	A Vector3 containing the Euler angles about the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes,
        in degrees, that specifies the base rotation about the pivot.  These
        angles are always processed in `'xyz'` order.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the matrix does not represent a valid
    transform matrix (e.g. it is singular), the transform order is not a
    permutation of the string `'srt'`, or the rotate order is not a
    permutation of the string `'xyz'`.

    See [Hom:hou.hmath#buildRotateAboutAxis] for an example of how to convert
    Euler angles into an axis and rotation.

    See [Hom:hou.ObjNode#setParmTransform] for an example.  This method is
    the inverse of [Hom:hou.hmath#buildTransform].  See also the other
    functions in [Hom:hou.hmath] that build transformation matrices.
