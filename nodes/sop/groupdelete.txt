"""Deletes groups of points, primitives, edges, or vertices according to patterns."""

== Overview ==

This operator removes groups of points, primitives, edges, or vertices.
It removes only the group, not the points or primitives themselves, however.

Patterns like `*` can be used to quickly clean up extra groups from geometry.

@inputs

Source geometry:
    The geometry from which to remove the groups.

@parameters

Number of Deletions:
    #id: deletions

    The number of deletion rules to apply.

Group Type:
    If set to any, all group types whose name match the pattern
    will be removed.  Otherwise, it only removes those groups
    of the same type as this field.

Groups:
    A space separated list of groups to remove.  `*` can be used
    as a wild card to match many groups at once.
