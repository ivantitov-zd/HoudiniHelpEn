== Overview ==

Cryptomatte is a multichannel image, typically in EXR format, that stores ID
and pixel coverage pairs, along with additional metadata that stores the
original name of each ID (be it material name, or object name, or any arbitrary
user property of your choosing).

It allows you to extract matte based on selected IDs which can be used to mask
out specific elements when making minor adjustments in compositing.

The following example illustrates how Cryptomatte is used to isolate gold
material and make hue adjustment in COP:

Please see Cryptomatte's [official site|https://github.com/Psyop/Cryptomatte]
for specifications and plugins for popular compositing applications.

== Using mantra to output Cryptomatte ==

# Select mantra ROP.

# Click on __Images__ > __Cryptomatte__ tab.

# Add a layer by clicking on `+` next to __Cryptomatte Layers__.

# Select the property to generate IDs from. You can use the dropdown menu to choose built-in properties, `Material Name` or `Object Name`.

    You can also type in any user string property that are added to objects or materials (using `Properties` node). See [render properties|/props/] for detailed information on how to add user properties to objects or materials.

# Set __Output Picture__ to the name of the Cryptomatte image you want to save. EXR format is strongly recommended.

# Render.

See [mantra properties|/props/mantra#vm_cryptolayers] for description of each
parameter.

== Instancing and unique IDs ==

In order to matte a particular instance among other instances, you need to generate Cryptomatte using a user string property whose value is unique to each instance.

Here's an example method using Material Stylesheets:

# Set up [instancing|/nodes/obj/instance].

# Make sure you're using __fast point instancing__.

# Using [Attribute Expression|/nodes/sop/attribexpression] (or any method you prefer), give each point inside `Instance` node a unique integer.

# Add a user string property to the `Instance` node.

# Add a root level stylesheet, target __Point Instances__, override script __Render Property__ using __Inline Script__, and set up appropriate bindings:

    Example inline script:
    {{{
    #!vex
    cvex myFn(int id=0; export string myuserprop="") 
    { 
	myuserprop = sprintf("foo%d", id);
    }
    }}}

In this example, the name of the user property is `myuserprop`. The name of the
point integer attribute is `mypointid`. The unique property values that are
generated are `foo0`, `foo1`, `foo2` etc (the # comes from `mypointid` attribute).

Note that, in this example, __Inline Script__ was only necessary to convert
integer attribute to string property. If you're using a string attribute then
you could simply use __Attribute Binding__ and skip the script and data binding
altogether.

See [Material Stylesheets|/shade/stylesheets] for more information on how to
use stylesheets.

== Using Cryptomatte COP ==

See [Cryptomatte COP|/nodes/cop2/cryptomatte] for more information.

== Tips and notes ==

* Keep in mind that opacity and transparency are two separate things: 
  Partially opaque materials let camera rays through, while transparent
  materials obstruct camera rays and cast secondary (refraction) rays. The
  pixel coverage is computed based on opacity, so you won't be able to generate
  matte for objects behind refractive materials.

* Cryptomatte uses the primary plane's [pixel filter|/props/mantra#vm_pfilter].
  Custom pixel filter plugins can be used as well, but a filter that reads data
  from additional image planes (for example, `minmax` filter reads data from
  `Z` plane) are not allowed.
