= Crowd Transition =

"""Defines a transition between crowd states."""

This node defines a [transition|/crowds/triggers] from one [crowd state|Node:dop/crowdstate] to another. The input is a [trigger|Node:dop/crowdtrigger] that initiates the transition when its condition evaluates to true.

@parameters

Input State:
	Name of the state to transition out of. This corresponds to the __State Name__ parameter on a [Crowd State|Node:dop/crowdstate] node.
Output State:
	Name of the state to transition into. This corresponds to the __State Name__ parameter on a [Crowd State|Node:dop/crowdstate] node.
Duration:
	Length of the transition between states in seconds.
Random Time Offset:
	Adds a random time offset to the start of the transition. This produces a more random look for the crowd.
Time:
	Specifies the maximum random time that the transition can be delayed by.

@inputs
	Crowd Trigger, Crowd Trigger Logic

@outputs
	Agent primitives
