"""Supports Capture and Deform operation by creating a volume within which
points are captured to a bone."""

Typically one or more Capture Regions are placed in an object (usually a
bone) and named "capture_region". The object is then read into a Capture
operation through the object's hierarchy. The object is moved to deform
the Capture operation's geometry with a Deform operation.

The Capture Region volume is a tube with hemispheres at each end. By
adjusting the shape of the capture region, you can affect how points are
weighted by the Capture operation. The closer a point is to the edge of
a region, the lighter the weight. Thus you can increase point weighting
by increasing the size of the region.

The parameters in the Region tab define the values used for deforming
the skin points while the values in the capture tab define the values
used for capturing them. The shape of the capture region used for
capturing can be viewed by setting
__Edit > Objects > Bone Kinematic Override: Capture Pose__ from the main menu.

Rig Adjustment parameters define a transform that nullifies deformations
that may be caused by bone position tweaking during a rigging process.
This happens after the geometry has been captured when bone joints need
to be adjusted to improve animation. After capturing, moving a bone is
going to deform the captured geometry. To reset this deformation, the
capture region in a deforming (animating) pose needs to be aligned back
with the capture region in a capturing pose. A transformation defined by
the Rig Adjustment parameters aligns the deform and the capture
incarnations of the capture region. This transformation is automatically
calculated by the Align Capture Pose tool or when an hscript command
"bonealigncapture" is invoked on bones. On a side note, the transform
order of the rig adjustment is RTS and rotation order is ZYX.

@parameters

== Region ==

=== Animate ===

Orientation:
    Defines the direction axis of the region. Use Z axis
    when the region is inside a bone object.
Center:
    Position of the center of the region `/t[xyz]`.
Rotate:
    Orientation of the region expressed as rotational angles
    in degrees around x, y, and z axis. The order of
    rotation follows that of a bone and is ZYX. Rotation is
    performed around the center of the region. `/t[xyz]`.
Squash and Stretch:
    Scaling parameters in the x, y, z axis direction of a
    local reference frame. Effectively, the parameters
    Center, Rotate, and Squash and Stretch for a
    transformation matrix with the RTS transform order and
    ZYX rotation order `/squash[xyz]`.
Top Height:
    Height of the region from the center to /theight the top
    cap.
Top Cap:
    X,Y,Z radii of the top hemisphere `/tcap[xyz]`.
Bottom Height:
    Height of the region from the center to /bheight the
    bottom cap.
Bottom Cap:
    X,Y,Z radii of the bottom hemisphere `/bcap[xyz]`.
Height Scale:
    Scaling factor for both Top and Bottom Height parameters
    /hscale.

=== Rig Adjustment ===

Rig Adjust Translate:
    translation `/rigadjustt[xyz]`.
Rig Adjust Rotate:
    rotation `/rigadjustr[xyz]`.
Rig Adjust Scale:
    scale `/rigadjusts[xyz]`.
Rig Adjust Z Factor:
    coefficient that scales the animation z-factor to equal
    the capture z-factor /rigadjustzfactor.

== Capture ==

Orientation:
    #id: corient

    A capture counterpart of the Orientation parameter in Region
    tab.
Center:
    #id: ct

    A capture counterpart of the Center parameter in Region tab.
Rotate:
    #id: cr

    A capture counterpart of the Rotate parameter in Region tab.
Squash and Stretch:
    #id: csquash

    A capture counterpart of the Squash and stretch parameter in
    Region tab.
Top Height:
    #id: ctheight

    A capture counterpart of the Top Height parameter in Region
    tab.
Top Cap:
    #id: ctcap

    A capture counterpart of the Top Cap parameter in Region
    tab.
Bottom Height:
    #id: cbheight

    A capture counterpart of the Bottom Height parameter in
    Region tab.
Bottom Cap:
    #id: cbcap

    A capture counterpart of the Bottom Cap parameter in Region
    tab.
Height Scale:
    #id: chscale

    A capture counterpart of the Height Scale parameter in
    Region tab.
    
Inner/Outer Weight:
    Defines the weight of a point exactly on the center line and
    edge of the region respectively. Point weights in between
    will be blended.

== Display ==

Display Color:
    #id: color

    The Capture operation uses region colors for helpful
    feedback. By default the region inherits the color of its
    containing object (via an expression).
