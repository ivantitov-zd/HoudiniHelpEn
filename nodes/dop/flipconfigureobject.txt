= FLIP Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Particle Fluid Objects to become a FLIP
based fluid."""

The FLIP Configure Object DOP takes a particle fluid object and attaches
the data which is needed for it to be used as a FLIP based fluid.

@parameters

Division Size:
    The [FLIP Fluid Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] creates a volume grid to perform velocity projection on.  The size of this grid does not have to match the actual particle sizes.

    If the division size is less than the particle size, unnecessary work
    will be done.

    A division size greater than the particle size will smear neighboring
    particles together, resulting in a smoother, stabler, and faster
    simulation.  The recommended division size is twice the particle
    desperation, so there will be approximately eight particles per grid
    cell.

    If you halve the division size, you create eight times the work.

Collision Division Size:
    #id: coldivsize
    
    The division size for the collision-related fields.

    It can be useful for the collision fields to be higher resolution than the other simulation fields, especially when protoyping simulations at low resolutions, since the [FLIP Fluid Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] takes into account fractional collision voxels when solving.
    
    If this value is set as a fraction of the overall __Division Size__, be careful to restore it when running high resolution simulations.  Another option is to choose a division size that provides sufficient collision detail by visualizing the collision field, then leave it at that fixed value, independent from any changes to the overall division size.

Density:
    #id: density

    The mass density of the fluid. This value is stored in the object's density field and can be manipulated in the __Volume Velocity__
    input of the [FLIP solver|Node:dop/flipsolver], or overriden with particle attributes by using its __Density__ tab.

Viscosity:
    #id: viscosity

    The dynamic viscosity of the fluid. The value of the __Viscosity__ 
    parameter depends on the scale of the particles. At the default scale, 
    you will need values around 1000 for a thick fluid, and around 10000 for 
    a doughy fluid. See the
    [discussion of viscosity|/fluid/liquids#viscosity] in the user
    guide.
    
    This value is stored in the object's viscosity field and can be manipulated in the __Volume Velocity__
    input of the [FLIP solver|Node:dop/flipsolver], or overriden with particle attributes by using its __Viscosity__ tab.
    
    __Enable Viscosity__ must be set on the __Viscosity__ tab of the [FLIP solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] for this setting to have any effect.

Add Divergence Field:
    #id: adddivergence

    Instead of always making the local particle velocities divergent free,
    one can instead introduce artificial divergence or convergence using the
    divergence field.  This field can also be manipulated by using
    the __Divergence__ tab of the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver].

Use External SOPs:
    
    This option will initialize the surface and/or velocity volumes from
    SOP volumes. This is useful when using the __Narrow Band__ option
    in the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] because it will no longer be
    necessary to fill the entire volume with particles to initialize
    the simulation.

Closed Boundaries:
    #id: closedends
    
    Controls if the particles should be allowed to go ballistic or hit an invisible glass wall when the maximum bounds is reached, as specified in the __Volume Limits__ tab of the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver].  Turning this checkbox on makes it easier to setup water tank style simulations.

== Guides ==

Each of the fields that define the FLIP fluid can be
visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the [Scalar Field
Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] or [Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] provides more
details about how these work.
