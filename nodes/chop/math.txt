"""Perform a variety of arithmetic operations on and between channels."""

This CHOP allows you to perform a variety of arithmetic operations on
and between channels. Channels of a CHOP can be combined, and several
CHOPs can be combined.

== Unary Operations ==

Unary operations are performed on individual channels. Unary operations are:

Off:
    Don't do anything to the channel.
Negate:
    Take the negative value of each sample of the channel.
Positive:
    Make negative values of the channel positive (absolute).
Root:
    Take the square root of all values in the channel.
Square:
    Square all the values in the channel.
Inverse:
    Take the inverse (1/x) of all values in the channel.

== Combine Channels ==

Operations between channels can be done within an input or between
inputs. The operations are done on a sample by sample basis:

Off:
    Don't combine the channels.
Add:
    Sum all the channels.
Subtract:
    Subtract all the channels from the first.
Multiply:
    Take the product of all the channels.
Divide:
    Divide the first channel by all the rest.
Average:
    Take the average of all the channels.
Maximum:
    Take the maximum value of all the channels.
Minimum:
    Take the minimum value of all the channels.
Length:
    Assume the channels are a vector and compute its length.

@parameters

== OP ==

Channel Pre OP:
    A menu of unary operations that are performed on single channels as they come in to the Math CHOP.
    
Combine Channels:
    A menu of operations that is performed between the channels of a single input CHOP, for each input.
    
Combine CHOPs:
    A menu of operations that is performed between the input CHOPs, combining several CHOPs into one.
    
Channel Post OP:
    A menu of more unary operations that is performed on the channels resulting from the above operations.
    
Match By:
    Match channels between inputs by name or number.

    When matching by name, the number of output channels is the number of channels from the first input. For each channel of the first input, the channel of the same name is taken from the other inputs.
    If a channel name cannot be found, then it is omitted. Only the channels whose names occur in the first input will be used to generate the output channels. Channels whose names do not occur in the first input will not affect the output channels. 

    When matching by number, the number of output channels is the maximum number of channels out of all the inputs. Then for each input, the original sequence of channels is repeated to match the number of output channels.

Match Failure:
    It is sometimes desirable to produce a warning or an error
    when channels in the first input fail to be correctly matched
    to channels in the other inputs. A failure may occur when matching
    by __Channel Number__ if an input has fewer channels than input 1, or
    when  matching by __Channel Name__ if a channel name cannot be found
    in input 1.
    
Align:
    The alignment to use when aligning channels from different inputs. See the help for the Merge CHOP.

== Mult-Add ==

Pre-Add:
    #channels: /preoff

    First, add value to each new channel.
Multiply:
    #channels: /gain

    Then multiply by this value.
Post-Add:
    #channels: /postoff

    Then add this value.

== Range ==

From/To Range:
    #channels: /fromrange12 /torange12

    Another way to multiply/add. Converts from one low-high
    range to another range.
