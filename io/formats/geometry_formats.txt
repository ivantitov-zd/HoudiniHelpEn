            Prisms ASCII format (polygons only).

            This format only supports polygonal geometry types. It is
            included in the Geometry Editor to maintain compatibility
            with other, older, systems.


            TIP:
                In a `.poly` file, the first point referred to by the
                polygons is point number 0.

            Uses `gdxf` - polygons only, no attributes.

            `.dxf` was invented by Autodesk for use with AutoCAD. It is
            a common geometry exchange format. `.dxf` format only
            supports polygonal geometry types.

            `.dxf` layers are mapped to groups when read into the SOP
            Editor. Texture and color information is lost if you save to
            a `.dxf` file.

            Uses `gwavefront` - polygons only. Only `texture` and
            `pointnormal` attributes (groups are kept on read).

            `.obj` was invented by Wavefront. It is a very common
            geometry exchange format. `.obj` supports polygons,
            textures, normals, and groups.

            Uses `gsdl` command.

            `.sdl` was invented by Alias/Wavefront. It was
            traditionally used as input to a renderer.

            Houdini can read `.sdl` files but cannot write them. Houdini
            only imports spline surface geometry (and instances of
            spline surfaces), and the name of each patch and shader is
            imported. It does not import colors and texture
            coordinates.

            Uses `geps` command.

            Houdini reads `.eps` files from Illustrator 5.5 as planar
            geometry. It does not import fills, patterns, or colors.

            Houdini will read Meta Editor metaball files, although
            eccentric information is lost upon loading.

        td>>
            Uses glightwave command.

            `.lw` was invented by NewTek for use with LightWave. Houdini
            supports objects from version 3.5 and earlier. Houdini only
            handles the following LightWave features:

            * points

            * polygons

            * surface names (as primitive groups)

            * surface color as primitive colors)

            * surface transparency as primitive alpha)

            * surface smoothing (as internal cusp operations)

            Houdini will ignore all other features. It cannot load files
            saved with layer information. The file to be loaded _must_
            contain points. However, it need not contain any polygons.

            NOTE:
                By default, LightWave objects are rendered as faceted
                (no smoothing) whereas in Houdini you must explicitly
                cusp polygons in order to achieve this. As a result, if
                you load an object that has no smoothing values set (all
                faceted) you will end up with all points in the
                resulting object being "unique-ed" - giving you a _much_
                larger data set. To get around this, manually convert
                the file using the `glightwave` utility with the `-s`
                option.

            Uses `gply` command.

            `.ply` was designed at Stanford University and UNC Chapel
            Hill, and is mostly used for academic research and with
            Cyberware scanners.

            The `.ply` format is a polygonal format. It can handle very
            large data sets, and supports vertex normals and colors.
            Houdini can read and write `.ply` files using the `gply`
            standalone program.

NOTE:
        Setting the environment variable `HOUDINI_GEOMETRY_FORMAT` to `hclassic` will set `.geo/.bgeo` to save as `.hclassic/.bhclassic` format. This will cause Houdini to save locked geometry in a format that can be read into older versions of Houdini. The older `hclassic` formats do not support all features of the newer geometry libraries, so use of the environment variable to override the format globally should be used with caution.
