"""Deletes points, primitives, and edges from the input geometry and
repairs any holes left behind."""

Unlike the [Delete SOP|Node:sop/delete], this operator fills any holes
left by the deleted edges.

TIP:
    This operator can easily create polygons with more than 4 sides.
    You may want to append a [Divide SOP|Node:sop/divide] to triangulate
    any N-sided polygons created by this operator.

== Using Dissolve ==

# Select the points, edges, or polygons you wish to dissolve.
        
# Click the [Icon:SOP/dissolve][Dissolve|/nodes/sop/dissolve] tool on the __Polygon__ tab.
        
Turning on the __Remove Inline Points__ checkbox on the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] will remove points that no longer have edges attached.

@parameters

Group:
    The points, primitives, or edges to delete. This field is treated
    as a set of edges. Edges that are not part of any entity in the
    group field do not get deleted.

    Normally you will use this operator in the scene view and simply
    select the edges you want; however, if you need to you can also
    use a space-separated list of the following codes in this field
    to specify edges:

    [Include:edgespec]

Operation:
    #id: invertsel


    Delete selected:
        Delete the entities listed in the __Group__ field.
    Delete non-selected:
        Delete all entities _except_ those listed in the __Group__
        field.

Recompute Normals:
    #id: compnorms

    Calculates the normals on remaining geometry after the deletion
    occurs.

Remove Inline Points:
    Removes points of dissolved edges if they do not affect the
    resulting shape.

Collinearity Tolerance:
    #id: coltol

    Points within this distance of being on the same line are
    deleted when __Remove Inline Points__ is on.

Delete Bridges:
    If a bridge edge, and only the bridge edge, are requested for deletion,
    this toggle determines if it will be deleted or not.  Since bridge
    edges are sort of virtual edges, it often is unexpected to see them be
    deleted.
