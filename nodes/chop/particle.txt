"""Produces translate and rotate channels to move Objects according to
the positions of particles in a POP Network."""

This CHOP produces translate and rotate channels to move Objects
according to the positions of particles in a POP Network. Channels are
generated for all particles with an _instance_ attribute.


@parameters

    == Particle ==

        POP Path:
            POP to cook.
        Method:
            Specifies whether the CHOP should generate channel values
            for the current frame (Dynamic) or for all frames at once
            (Cached).
        Extract Scope:
            Specifies a mask of channels to generate.
        Update:
            Forces an update of the CHOP if it is in Static mode.

    == Channel ==

	Channel Range:
	    Indicates how much of the channel to cook.

	    Use Full Animation Range:
		All of the current global animation range.
	    Use Current Frame:
		Only the sample at the current frame.
	    Use Start/End:
		Specify the range using the Start/End parameters.
        Start, End:
            The start time of the channels. 
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample rate of the channels.
        Extend Left:
            The left extend conditions.
        Extend Right:
            The right extend conditions.
        Default Value:
            #channels: /defval

            The default value for extend conditions.
