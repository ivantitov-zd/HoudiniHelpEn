= Cloth Target Properties =

"""Defines how cloth uses target."""

The Cloth Target Properties DOP controls how target influences the simulation.
At each frame, the cloth solver looks at the position and velocity of the points that are stored in the attribute `targetP` of the __Simulation Geometry__ on the [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject].

@parameters
    Target Stiffness:
        #channels: /targetstiffness

        This determines how quickly the simulated cloth will adapt its position to the positions in the `targetP` point attribute. The higher you make this value, the more aggressively the cloth will try to match the target positions. However, to get smooth-looking results you will need to set __Target Damping__ as well.

    Target Damping:
        #channels: /targetdamping

        This determines how quickly the simulated cloth will adapt its velocity to the trajectory that is determined by the 'targetP' point attribute. The higher you make this value, the more aggressively the cloth will try to match the target velocities. By setting this value high enough, you will prevent the simulated cloth from moving around the target cloth in a springy or jittery way.
