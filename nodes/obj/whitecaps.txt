"""Emits particles from the leading edges of a Particle Fluid wave, when the sharpness of the wave crest reaches a certain threshold."""

This tool emits particles from the leading edge of a surface created from a [Particle Fluid|Node:dop/particlefluidobject] simulation that has been surfaced using the [Icon:SOP/particlefluidsurface][Particle Fluid Surface|Node:sop/particlefluidsurface]. It is useful for creating foam on the top of a moving wave. 

This tool extracts the curvature of the wave, births particles, and creates a particle simulation. Particle emission is based on the curvature and velocity magnitude of the surface points, as it emits particles from the high curvature of the leading edge and inherits the velocity of the wave as it moves along with it.

NOTE:
    You can use the tools on the __Drive Particles__ shelf to alter the particle network.

@parameters

Point Samples:
    The number of points that are used to sample the curvature of the 
    fluid surface.
Magnitude Threshold:    
    Minimum:
       The minimum velocity magnitude threshold to emit particles.
    Maximum:
            The maximum velocity magnitude threshold to emit particles.
Source Rate:
    Controls the number of particles that are emitted.

    Sample Points:
        The number of particles is equal to the number of sample points that
        have a magnitude in the threshold range.
    Specified:
        The number of particles is always equal to the specified number.
Sample Multiplier:
    Scale the number of samples used to emit particles when emitting from
    Sample Points
Specified Rate:
    Specify the number of particles to be emitted.
