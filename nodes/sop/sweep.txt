= Sweep =

"""Creates a surface by sweeping cross-sections along a backbone
curve."""

The Sweep op sweeps primitives in the Cross-section input along Backbone
curve(s), creating ribbon and tube-like shapes. The cross-section
primitives are placed at each point of the backbone perpendicular to it.
If a Reference Point input is given, each primitive will be oriented to
aim at its corresponding reference point.

* The backbone curve can be open or closed, but must have at least two
  points.

* If the backbone input has more than one primitive, Sweep will sweep
  the cross section along each one.

* If the cross-section input has multiple primitives, you can control
  them using the __Cycle type__ parameter.

* Sweep places the _origin_ of the cross-section on the backbone by
  default. You can specify a point on the cross-section to attach to the
  backbone instead with the __Use vertex__ and __Connection vertex__
  parameters.

* In most cases, you should build the cross section primitives in the XY
  plane. Sweep will automatically orient them properly along the
  backbone.

* If the backbone curve(s) have point colors or texture coordinates,
  they will be maintained and applied to the cross section primitives.

@parameters
    X-Section Group:
        #channels: /xgrp

        Only use the geometry in this group as the cross-section, instead of all geometry in the first input.
    Path Group:
        #channels: /pathgrp

        Only use the geometry in this group as the backbone curve(s), instead of all geometry in the second input.
    Reference Group:
        #channels: /refgrp

        Only use the geometry in this group as reference points, instead of all geometry in the third input.
    Cycle Type:
        #channels: /cycle

        How to sweep the primitives.
    Angle Fix:
        #channels: /angle

        Attempt to fix buckling twists.
    Fix Flipping:
        #channels: /noflip

        Fixes flipped normals.
    Remove Coincident Points on Path:
        #channels: /skipcoin

        Removes overlapping points.
    Aim at Reference Points:
        #channels: /aimatref

        Tilt the cross-sections towards their respective reference points from the Reference Points input.  The Reference Points input will still be used to roll the cross-sections around the backbone even when this parameter is turned off.
    Use Vertex:
        #channels: /usevtx

        Connect a specific vertex of the cross-section to the backbone.
    Connection Vertex:
        #channels: /vertex

        Specific vertex to connect to backbone.
    Transform Using Attributes:
        #id: xformbyattrib

        When enabled, instead of using the __Scale__, __Twist__, and __Roll__ parameters,
        the cross-sections are transformed using the backbone attributes: `pscale`, `scale`,
        `N`, `up`, `trans`, `rot`, `orient`, and `pivot`.  If none of `N`, `up`, `trans`, `rot`, `orient`, or `pivot` are specified, (possibly `pscale` or `scale` still), the rotation from the curve will be used.
    Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        Uniform scale of cross-section.
    Twist:
        #channels: /twist

        Cumulative rotation of cross-sections around the backbone.
    Roll:
        #channels: /roll

        Non-cumulative rotation of cross-sections around the backbone.
    Create Groups:
        #channels: /newg

        Creates a group for each backbone.
    Sweep Groups:
        #channels: /sweepgrp

        Allows naming of the sweep groups. A separate group is created for each backbone by appending a number to the group name. If there is only one backbone, the created group will be called sweepGroup1.
    Attributes from Path:
        #id: ptattribs

        These point attributes and groups will be copied from the backbone points to the cross-section points.
        If a `uv` attribute is present on both the cross-section and backbone, and __Cycle Type__ is set to either __One Primitive at a Time__ or __Cycle Primitives__,
        only the u component will be copied from the backbone, so the v component will still be from the cross-section `uv` attribute.
        Although only point attributes are copied from the backbone, there is a special case for if the cross-section has a vertex `uv` attribute, point `uv` values can be
        copied into the destination vertex `uv` attribute, but this only works for `uv`.
    Skin Output:
        #channels: /skin

        How/whether to create a surface connecting the cross-sections along the backbone.


        Off:
            Do not create a surface.
        On:
            Skin each set of swept cross-sections.
        On with Auto Close:
            Skin each set and close if the underlying path is closed.
        On with Preserve Shape:
            Like __On__ above, but ensure the swept curves are fully encased in the resulting surface.
        On with Preserve Shape and Auto Close:
            Skin with __Preserve Shape__ and __Auto Close__ put together.
    Fast Sweep:
        #channels: /fast

        More efficient skinning. Use when the input geometries maintain
        the same topologies between cooks and each cross-section has the
        same number of points.
    Output Polygons:
        #channels: /polyout
        Outputs meshes as polygons rather than meshes.
@inputs
    Cross-section:
        The geometry to sweep along the backbone curve.
    Backbone path:
        The curve(s) to sweep the cross-section shape along.
    Reference Points:
        If this input is connected, each primitive will be oriented to
        aim at its corresponding reference point in this geometry.
@locals
    PT:
        Current vertex. It is the current point along the current path.
    NPT:
        Total number of points.
    PATH:
        Path primitive number. It tells you which path you are on.
    PCT:
        Percentage along backbone (path).
        
NOTE:
        `$PT` can't be used to directly index a point in the source, you need to use `$PATH` to access the proper primitive, and `$PT` the correct vertex in that primitive.
