==== Color ====
Use Base Color:

    Use values stored in the object geometry's `Cd` point attributes to color the surface. If __Use base color__ and/or __Use color map__ are also on, the point color will be multiplied with them.

Use Packed Color:
    #id: usePackedColor

    Use color attributes on packed primitives. This is multiplied against the existing diffuse color values.

Use Map:
    #id: useColorMap

    The texture map to use for surface shading when __Use color map__ is on.

Tint Intensity:
    #id: colorMapIntensity

    The blending factor between the base color and the color map, from `0` (base color only) to `1` (fully blend the color map with the base color).

=== Emission ===

==== General ====

Enable Emission:
    #id: emit_enable

    Add a constant amount of diffuse light emitted from the surface. For example, with emission on, the object would be visible in the render even
    if none of the light objects were shining on it. This may be useful in
    some circumstances, but normally you should simply use an
    [Area Light|Node:obj/hlight] to add light to the scene more efficiently
    and controllably, especially if you need to add a lot of light.

Emission Illuminates Objects:
    #id: emit_illum

    The light emitted by this object will brighten the surfaces of other
    objects. When this option is off, the emitted light will be visible in
    the camera, but will not fall on other objects in the scene.

Intensity:
    #id: emit_int

    The amount of emission.

    #id: emit_clr

    The color of the emitted light.

    Use a texture map for the emission color.

Map:
    The texture map to use when __Use Map__ is on.

Tint Intensity:
    The amount of influence the map has on the final color.

=== Opacity ===

==== General ====

_Opacity_ controls how transparent the object is _in the scene_ (that is, how visible are things behind the object in the scene). _Alpha_ controls the _alpha channel_ of the rendered image (that is, how transparent are the _pixels in the rendered image_ corresponding to the shaded surface).

[Include:/nodes/vop/surfacemodel#opac_int]

==== Color ====

Color:
    #id: baseOpacityColor

    The opacity of the red, green, and blue channels of the shaded surface color.

Tint Intensity:
    #id: opacityMapIntensity

== Displacement ==

=== General ===

Map-Based Displacement:
    #id: enableDispMap

    Use a texture map to displace the surface of the object at render time.

Noise-Based Displacement:
    Use a noise function to displace the surface of the object at render time.

The controls on this tab let you apply a displacement map and/or a bump map to the shaded surface.

TIP:
    You do not need to set up your own "displacement bounds" render properties when doing displacement. This material automatically sets the displacement bounds.

Displacement Scale:
    #id: dispScale

    The scaling factor for values in the displacement textures. This depends on the scale of the scene, but will usually be very small. For example, if the scaling factor was `1.0`, a value of `1` in the map would cause a displacement of 1 Houdini length unit.

Displacement Bound:
    #id: vm_displacebound
    The maximum bounds that the displacement shader will move geometry. This is defined in "camera" space. The absolute value is used to determine the bounds.

True Displacements:
    #id: vm_truedisplace

    Whether to do "real" displacement (actually modify geometry at render time, allowing the silhouette of the object to change). If you turn this option off, the values of the displacement tab will be used as a bump map (creating the appearance of depth but not actually modifying the geometry or changing the object's silhouette).

=== Map ===

Displacement Map:
    #id: displacementMap

    The texture to use for displacing the surface.

Channel:
    #id: switchDispChannel

    The channel of the texture image to use as the displacement value.

    If set to XYZ Displace, the RGB channels will be treated as absolute
    displacements in object space.  This is useful for displacing the
    maps created by the [Ocean Evaluate SOP|Node:sop/oceanevaluate].  Usually a scaling factor
    of 1 should be used in this case and the displacement bound set
    to the maximum wave height.

Filter Width:

=== Noise ===

Noise Type:
    #id: noiseType

    Different types of noise have different characteristics. Perlin is the standard noise. Original Perlin is similar to Perlin noise, but marginally slower to compute and with different characteristics. Sparse convolution is slower to computer and looks more random. Alligator noise is slower to computer and a very different, more cellular look from the other noise types.

Frequency:
    #id: noiseFreq

    The scale of the noise pattern.  Larger values give smaller, but not more
    detailed patterns.

Offset:
    #id: noiseOffset

    Positions the noise in X, Y, and Z.

Amplitude:
    #id: noiseAmp

    Scales the output of the noise function.

Roughness:
    #id: noiseRough

    Sharpens or softens the edges of the noise.  Lower values are
    softer, higher values sharper.

Attenuation:
    #id: noiseAtten

    Shifts the median value of the noise.  Values greater than 1 dampen the noise down, while values less than 1 sharpen the contrast between noise values.

Turbulence:
    #id: noiseTurb

    Controls the amount of detail in the noise. This is the number of times the noise function is called and summed. If the Frequency is high, there is no need for much detail, 1 or 2 should be plenty. This can affect the __Amplitude__ of the noise as well since the summing will result in
    higher base values.

== Bump & Normal ==

Round Edge Radius:
    When enabled, averages normals around the specified radius (in Houdini units). This can be useful to fake beveled edges on hard surfaces.

Map Type:
    #id: mapType

    A _normal map_ directly sets the surface normals. A _bump map_ modifies the displaced normals. Set to "None" to not modify the normals.

=== Bump ===

Use Map:
    Use a texture map for bump mapping.

Bump Scale:
    #id: bumpScale

    A scaling factor for the values in the bump texture.

Map:
    #id: bumpMap

    The texture to use for the bump map, when __Map type__ is "Bump".

=== Normal ===

    The texture map to use for normal mapping.

    #id: normalMapWrap
    #contentfrom: /nodes/vop/surfacecolor#mapwrap
