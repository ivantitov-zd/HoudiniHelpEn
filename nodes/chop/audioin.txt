= Audio In =

"""Receives audio input from the analog audio ports or the digital
port."""

This CHOP receives audio input from the analog audio ports or the
digital port. It always outputs time sliced audio data. If you want to
record the data, use a [Record CHOP|Node:chop/record].

NOTE:
    Receiving audio from an audio CD using a CD-ROM is not supported.
    Instead, feed the audio through the Audio-in port.


@parameters

    == Audio ==

        Audio Source:
            Selects the audio port to listen to.

            Microphone:
                Listens to the analog microphone port.
            Line:
                Listens to the analog line in port.
            Digital:
                Listens to the digital port.
        Audio Format:
            Selects mono, stereo, or 4 channel mode. 4 Channel mode is
            not available on all systems. This parameter also determines
            how many channels are created (1, 2 or 4).
        Use Global Sample Rate:
            If on, audio is sampled at the system input sample rate.
            Otherwise, the next parameter allows you to change the
            system input sample rate. 

	    NOTE:
		This may disrupt other applications using the audio system. This parameter does not set the actual channel sample rate; that is set by the __Sample Rate__ parameter in the __Channel__ tab. These two sample rates can differ; the audio is resampled to the channel sample rate.

        Input Sample Rate:
            #channels: /inrate

            The sample rate of the audio input system.
        Record Queue:
            #channels: /queue

            The number of seconds of audio to buffer at the input. Input
            audio will be delayed by this amount of time. A large buffer
            allows for slower cooking; if the buffer is too small, gaps
            and pops will be heard in the audio.

    == Levels ==

        Channel 1-4:
            #channels: /chan1vol

            Each channel can be scaled separately by any factor.
        Input Attenuation:
            #channels: /inputatten

            This parameter controls the audio system hardware's input
            attenuation, which corresponds to the "record level" of a
            tape recorder. 0 is the lowest recording level, and 1 is the
            highest recording level. If you notice audio is being
            clipped at +-1, lower this value.

    == Channel ==

        Channel 1-4 Name:
            The names of the audio channels.
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample rate of the audio channels. This may be different
            from the audio input's sample rate; the input audio will be
            resampled to the CHOP's sample rate.
        Extend Left, Right:
            The extend conditions for the audio channels.
        Default Value:
            #channels: /defval

            The default value for the 'Default Value' extend condition.
