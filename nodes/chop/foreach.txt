"""Divides the input channels into groups, cooking the contained network for each group."""

Foreach is a specialized subnet which processes its channels in small
groups, by cooking the contained network multiple times for each group. This 
makes processing of hundreds of particles or objects much easier to manage since 
the network only needs to be designed to handle a single object.

By specifying a channel group pattern, the channels of input 1 are sorted into
groups. Each group is processed by the subnet without the other channels.
The channel names within the subnet have the channel group name removed from
them, so that they are always consistently named. The subnet may manipulate
the channels in any way, by adding, modifying, renaming or removing channels. 
The remaining channels at the output of the subnet are added to the Foreach node's 
output channels by reintegrating the channel group name back into them.

The subnet contains a For node, 4 subnet inputs, and an Output node. The For
node contains the channels of the currently processed channel group. The first
subnet input contains all the channels that are being iterated over, in case
collision detection or some other inter-group relationship needs to be 
performed. The other 3 subnet inputs allow for constant input to the subnet.

The output node is a convenience.  The Foreach draws its output from the node
with the Audio flag set. 

The current loop iteration can be queried from the For CHOP's 'Current Loop 
Index' parameter using a ch() expression.

Note: 
      Channels that are not assigned to a channel group will not be processed
      or present in the output.

@parameters

== Foreach ==

   Channel Group:
      A set of patterns which describe the members of the channel groups. A 
      wildcard `*` is used to indicate the varying part of the channel name.
      A channel group is formed by the channels that match the patterns when
      `*` is replaced by the channel group name.

      For example, a pattern of `leg*:tx leg*:ty leg*:tz` would create a 
      channel group called `4` when `leg4:tx`, `leg4:ty` and `leg4:tz` are in the 
      channels of input 1. 

      Note: 
      	    The channel group does not need to be numeric. The match pattern 
	    could be `*:tx *:ty *:tz`, giving a channel group of `leg4` 
	    in the above example.

   Channel Indexing:
      The channel group name is stripped out of the channels inside the subnet
      so that the channel names remain constant within the loop. When these 
      channels are added to the Foreach CHOP, their names are combined with the
      channel group name to create a unique name for every channel in the 
      channel group.

      Append:
          The channel group name is appended to the channel name.

      Replace Token:
          A text string is used to identify where the channel name should be
          inserted into the channel name. 

      Insert at First Separator:
          The channel group is inserted before the first : or / separator
	  in the channel name.

      Insert at Last Separator:
          The channel group is inserted before the last : or / separator in
	  the channel name.

   Group Token:
      The token being replaced when the __Channel Indexing__ mode is Replace. It
      should be a text string that isn't going to naturally occur in your 
      channels (ie, 't'). Each of the output channels inside the Foreach CHOP
      should contain this token somewhere in their name (ie, handIDX:tx, for
      a token of IDX).

   Renumber From:
      If enabled, the channel group name is ignored and replaced with a number
      starting at the specified index, increasing by 1 for each loop.

   Preview Groups:
      If enabled, only the specified channel groups are processed. This allows
      for a quick preview of a fraction of the groups.

   Debug Group:
      If enabled, the specified channel group is processed last. This leaves 
      the contained subnet in the state that cooked this channel group, so that
      problems can be investigated and debugged. This only works for a single
      channel group.
