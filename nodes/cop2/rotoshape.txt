"""Draws one or more curves or shapes."""

Rotoshape lets you draw and animate multiple curves and shapes.
You can draw shapes freehand, select from a list of presets, or copy an existing shape.
Each shape has its own color, feathering, closure (open, closed, hollow) and transform.

A rotoshape node can draw an unlimited number of shapes.
By default, the node composites the shapes using Over, but you can choose a different operation.
For example, you can use Subtract or XOR to cut holes in other shapes.
The node composites shapes on black starting with shape 1.

[Include:is_a_generator]

The RotoShape state has two modes - Create mode and Edit mode. Initially
RotoShape is in Create mode.

== Create Mode == (rotoshapecreatemode)

Create mode is where new shapes are added - either freehand drawn
curves or preset shapes. Once the shape is created, press 'Done' in
the toolbox or ((RMB)) Click in the viewport to finish the shape. To
quit this state without creating a curve or shape, hit ((Esc)) or
press 'Cancel' in the toolbox.

[Image:../images/RotoShapeCreationMode.jpg]

_From left to right, the UI controls for Create mode are:_

* *Curve Type* - Polygon or Bezier

* *Shape Type * - Curve, Regular Polygon, Star or Circle

* Parameters specific to the shape type:

* *Closure Type* - Open, Closed or Hollow

* *Copy* - Copies an existing shape.

* *Cancel* - Exit create mode without creating the shape. ((Esc))

* *Done* - Complete create mode and create the shape. ((N))

:task:Create a freehand curve:
    # Enter Create mode if you are not already in it.
    
    # Set the shape type to 'Curve'.
    
    # Select either Polygon or Bezier for the curve type. This can
      be changed in Edit mode as well.
    
    # Create a freehand curve by clicking to plot a single point, or
      dragging to create a curve stroke. ((Del)) will delete the
      last stroke (or plotted point), while ((Shift + Del)) will
      delete only the last point.
    
    # You can specify if the curve is closed (solid shape), open
      (open curve) or hollow (closed curve) by using the menu in the
      toolbar. This can also be changed in Edit mode.
    
    # When you are ready to complete the curve, ((RMB)) click in the
      viewport or press 'Done' in the toolbox.

:task:Create a preset shape:
    # Enter Create mode if you are not already in it.
    
    # Set the shape type to one of the following:
    
    # Use the transform handle to position the shape. The transform
      does not carry over into the Edit mode's transform for the
      shape, so it is useful for setting the initial orientation
      without having a dirty transform in Edit mode.
    
    # When you are finished, ((RMB)) click in the viewport or press
      'Done' in the toolbox to create the shape and return to edit
      mode.

:task:Copy an existing shape:
    # Enter Create Mode if you are not already in it.
    
    # Press the 'Copy' button and select one of the existing shapes.
      The shape is copied and you are returned to Edit mode.

== Edit Mode == (rotoshapeeditmode)

Edit mode allows you to edit the shapes by using handles. In this
mode, you can animate the shape. The parameters for the current
shape are found in the toolbox. To add another shape, press 'New' in
the toolbox or ((RMB)) Click in the viewport.

[Image:../images/RotoShapeEditMode.jpg]

_From left to right, the UI controls for Edit mode are:_

* *New* - Create a new curve or shape. ((N))

* *Show Current/All Curves* - Show the handles for only the current
  shape, or all the shapes.

* *Current Shape* - Selects the current shape, if there is more than
  one. Only the current shape's parameters are shown in the toolbox.
  If Show Current Shape is on, this also changes the handles visible
  in the viewport. ((B))

* *Curve Type* - Polygon or Bezier

* *Composite Operation* - Selects the compositing operation used to
  draw the shape into the image. Normally only needed for the second
  and subsequent shapes.

* *Closure Type* - Open, Closed or Hollow.

* *Thickness* - Determines the global thickness of open and hollow
  shapes. Each point on the shape can thickened individually by
  using the ((MMB)) slider on the point.

* *Feather* - Turns on feathering for the shape, and sets the
  minimum feather amount. Each point can be feathered individually
  by enabling the feather handle (((W)) while over the point, or use
  the ((RMB)) menu on the Point and select 'Display Feather
  Handle').

* *Color* - Pops up a color editor for the color and alpha of the
  shape.

* *Fill Inside/Outside* - Inverts the filling of the shape.

* *Delete Current Curve* - Deletes the current curve.

Edit Mode allows you to modify the shape of the curve as well as its
parameters. To show the parameters of a given shape, change the
'Current Shape' menu to the shape of interest. If 'Show Current
Shape' is enabled, this will also change which shape's handles are
displayed in the viewport.

:task:Select a different shape to edit:
    You can show the handles of another shape two ways:

    # Using the 'Current Shape' menu in the toolbox, select
      another shape.

    # Turn on all the shapes' handles using the 'Show All
      Handles' button in the toolbox.

:task:Use polygon handles:
    # ((LMB)) drag the point to change its location.

    # If the curve closure is Open or Hollow, using ((MMB))
      slider on the point will change that point's thickness.

    # If feathering is on, press ((W)) while over the point to
      display the feather handle (or use the 'Show Feather
      Handle' menu item in the point's ((RMB)) menu)

:task:Use Bezier handles:
    # ((LMB)) drag the center point to change its location.

    # If the curve closure is Open or Hollow, use the ((MMB))
      slider on the point to change that point's thickness.

    # If feathering is on, press ((W)) while over the point to
      display the feather handle (or use the 'Show Feather
      Handle' menu item in the point's ((RMB)) menu)

    # ((LMB)) click the bezier point to tie or untie the
      slopes.

    # Grabbing the slope line will only change the direction,
      without changing the length.

    # Grabbing the ball at the end of the slope allows you to
      change both the length and the direction.

    # To change the slope length only, hold down ((Ctrl)) while
      moving the slope ball. Alternatively, use the ((MMB))
      slider on the slope to increase or decrease its length.

    # For tied slopes, changing the slope length with
      automatically scale the other slope. To only affect the
      one slope, hold down ((Shift)) while scaling the slope.

    # For untied slopes, one slope is completely independent of
      the other. To change both at the same time, hold down
      ((Shift)).

:task:Select shape points:
    # To box select, ((LMB)) drag the selection box around the
      points to select. You can also use a ((Alt + LMB)) drag to
      avoid accidentally moving points or slopes.

    # To pick a specific point, ((Alt + LMB)) click the point.

    # Points are always added to the selection. To clear the
      selection, box pick or ((Alt + LMB)) pick empty space.

:task:Insert a point:
    ((Ctrl))-click near the
    segment you want to insert the point on (it doesn't have to be on
    the curve).

    If you have more than shape, and have displayed all the shapes'
    handles, the shape with the curve edge closest to the point
    clicked will be the one to receive the new point. To ensure the
    point gets added to the correct shape, display only the current
    shape's handles, and make the current shape the one you want to
    insert a point on.

:task:Delete a point:
    * Using the ((RMB)) handle menu, select 'Remove Point'.
    
      _or_

    * Move the mouse over the point and press ((Del)).

:task:Animate a shape's points:
    Pressing ((K)) in the viewport to
    set a keyframe, just like animating other handles. However, the
    scope of the keyframe varies depending on the handles visible and
    selection:

    Mouse pointer located over a handle:
        Only the handle under the point is keyframed.
        
    All Shapes' Handles shown, no selection:
        Every shapes' points and transforms will be keyframed.
        
    Current Shape's Handles shown, no selection:
        The current shape will be keyframed, but none of the other
        shapes will be.
        
    Selected Handles:
        Only the selected handles will be keyframed. This includes
        transform handles, if they are selected.

    To avoid keyframing the transform, temporarily turn the
    transform handle off by using the transform's ((RMB)) menu turn
    off 'Display Handle'. To get the handle back, you'll need to
    open the bar to the left of the viewport and toggle the transform
    icon for the shape.

    _Or_

    Keyframe the transform anyway and use the ((RMB)) menu on the
    transform to 'Remove Keyframe' (make sure the handle isn't
    selected).

:task:Feather the edges of a shape:
    # Turn on feathering toggle in the toolbox.

    # Adjust the global feather to the amount of feather that you
      want on the curve using the toolbox feather amount.

    # To adjust individual points, turn on the feather handle by
      pressing ((W)) while the mouse is over the point, or, using
      the point's ((RMB)) menu, select 'Show Feather Handle'.

    # Pull the feather handle outwards from the point to increase
      the feather.

    # The feather falloff can also be adjusted in the parameter
      dialog, to change it to Linear, Ease In, Ease Out, Ease In
      Ease Out or Gaussian. The default is Gaussian.

@parameters

== RotoShape ==

Level of Detail:
    #id: detail

    The level of detail when rendering smooth curve shapes.
    Higher values create smoother shapes. A LOD of 2 is normally
    adequate. Lower this value will speed up rendering slightly.

Antialias:
    #id: antialias

    The level of antialiasing, both horizontally and
    vertically. This can vary from 1 to 8. Higher levels of
    antialiasing will produce more levels of gray on edges, but
    increase rendering time. The product of the horizontal and
    vertical antialias setting cannot exceed 64 (8x8).

Number of shapes:
    Use this to add or remove controls for additional shapes.

== Shape controls ==

=== Curve ===

Spline Type:
    The primitive type of the created curve.

Shape Composite:
    The composite operation used to add the shape to
    the image. The shapes are composited starting with
    shape #1, up to the last shape.

Fill:
    The closure type of the shape.

    Open:
        Useful for curves, this creates an open shape
        with a given thickness.
    Closed:
        Creates a solidly filled, closed shape.
    Hollow:
        Creates a hollow shape with a closed curve of a
        given thickness.

Thickness:
    For open and hollow shapes, this determines the
    global thickness of the curve. Each point can also
    further modify the thickness.
    
Feather:
    If on, feathering is enabled, providing a very soft
    edge for the shape.
    
Feather Dropoff:
    How the feathering is interpolate across the edge
    of the shape.

Feather Ramp:
    Defines the dropoff when `Feather Dropoff` is set to `Ramp`.

Feather Width:
    The global feathering width. The shape will always
    have at least this much feathering.
    
Color:
    The color and alpha of the shape.
    The shape is not pre-multiplied.
    
Fill Outside:
    If on, the filling of the shape is inverted. For
    example, closed shapes will leave their interior
    unfilled and fill everywhere else.
    
Translate:
    The translate component of the shape's transform,
    which is applied first. It is expressed in UV units
    `(1 = X/Y res pixels)`.
    
Scale:
    The scale component of the shape's transform,
    applied second.
    
Rotation:
    The rotation of the shape.
    
Pivot:
    The pivot of the shape's transform, about which the
    scale and rotation occur. It is an offset from the
    translated position expressed in UV units.

=== Points ===

This tab contains all the points in the current shape.
Usually you will edit the points interactively rather than using these controls.

Number of points:
    You can use this to add or remove additional points.

Point <<n>>:
    The UV position of the point.
    
Tie Slopes:
    The slope position of the point, for bezier
    shapes. If the toggle is on, the slopes are
    tied.
    
Thickness:
    The point thickness, which is multiplied by the
    global thickness. Only applicable for open or
    hollow shapes.
    
Feather:
    The point feather, which is added to the global
    feather. Only applicable when feathering a
    curve.
