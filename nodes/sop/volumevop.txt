= Volume VOP =

"""Runs CVEX on a set of volume primitives."""

The Volume VOP operation runs CVEX over a set of volume
primitives.  The CVEX shader can be defined as a .vfl file, a Shop, or
by building a CVEX VOP network inside this node.  The last is the most
straightforward approach.

Binding to the CVEX script controls what values are passed to which
parameters of the script.  The default AutoBind will look at the name
attribute of the volumes to determine which parameter they should
override.  If that parameter is marked as exported in the CVEX script,
the volume will be written to.  Otherwise, the volume is just read to
get the parameter's values.  If a name attribute is not present, the
first volume is bound to the "density" parameter which is provided in
the default output and global parameters.

The CVEX script is applied once for each exported volume primitive.
Locally defined `ix`, `iy`, `iz`, `resx`, `resy`, `resz`, `orig`, and `P` bindings are
created that refer to the index, resolution, center, and current voxel
position of the currently exported primitive.

The parameters list starts with parameters created by the CVEX
script's parameters.  If the parameter is meant only to be bound to a
volume, it can be hidden by setting the invisible flag on the VOP
parameter.

== Adding user-defined colors to volumes ==

You can only have one volume per attribute, which means you need three volumes to represent r, g, and b in the render. Then you can process each volume individually, all together as a single Volume VOP network, or use the [Volume Mix SOP|Node:sop/volumemix] in user mode and modify `$V` which is the voxel value at the current sample voxel point.

Pay close attention to what is happening in the Volume VOP. You index in to the various volumes via a [Bind VOP|Node:vop/bind] set up to the exact same name as the name attribute present with the associated volume primitive. To export it back out, you need the same named parameter in a Bind Export VOP.

@parameters

== Vex Setup ==

        Vex Source:
                Where to get the CVEX script from.  Myself will refer to the VOP network built inside this node.  SHOP will use the __Shop Path__ and __Script__ will load the .vex file specified in the script.

	Shop Path:
                The CVEX Shop to apply.

                This can also point to any node that contains a CVEX VOP Network.
	    
                NOTE:
                        Referenced nodes parameters will be used.

	Script:
	    The CVEX script to apply.

	Re-load VEX Functions:
	    When in script mode, this reloads any .vex files to
	    account for updates made outside of Houdini.

	Compiler:
	    The command line used by VOPs to compile the inside of
	    this node.

	Force Compile:
	    Trigger a recompile of the VOP network.

	Evaluation Node Path:
	    VEX functions like `ch()` usually evaluate with respect to this node.
	    Providing a path here can override where the path search starts
	    from.  This is useful for embedding in a digital asset where you
	    would like the top level digital asset to be the search root.

	Export Parameters:
	    This pattern can be used to override
	    the export option on the VEX shader to avoid writing to 
	    certain volumes.  The pattern matches the VEX parameter, not
	    the bound volume.  The volume will still be bound for reading.

	Enable Multithreading:
	    There should be no threading issues with VEX.  In the unlikely
	    event that there are, this will allow you to determine which
	    node is guilty, and work around it without turning off threading
	    on a global scale.

== Volume Bindings ==

	Only Output Created Geometry:
	    Don't output any of the incoming volumes.  Instead, the output
	    will consist of only geometry created by the VOPs.  This
	    is useful if generating points from volumes.  Note you will
	    still have to do a dummy write to any volume you wish
	    to iterate over.

	Signed-Flood Fill Output SDF VDBs:
	    When narrow-band SDFs are processed the sense of the interior cells
	    can be lost.  This results in the interior being falsely output with
	    the default background value.  This option will do the sweep to
	    reset these tiles to the correct sense.  It only affects VDBs which
	    are of grid class SDF.

	Autobind by Name:
	    Will use the name primitive attribute to determine which
	    volume binds with which parameter.  If the name attribute
	    isn't present, the first volume is bound to density.

	    A name like "foo" will be bound to the float parameter
	    "foo".  A name of "foo.x" will be bound to the x
	    component of the vector (three float) parameter "foo".  A
	    name like "foo.zx" will be bound to the x,z component of
	    the matrix (three by three) parameter "foo".
	
	Bind Each to Density:
	    The VOP network will be applied to each volume in turn, with the
	    volume bound to density.

	Primitive, Primitive Name, VEX Parameter:
	    Manually specifies the bindings of each primitive.  This
	    is equivalent to those primitives having a name attribute
	    with the given name.  If Primitive Name is not empty,
	    the primitive with the matching name will be bound to the
	    given vex parameter.
