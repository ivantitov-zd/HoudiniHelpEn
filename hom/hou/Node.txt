"""The base class for all nodes in Houdini (objects, SOPs, COPs, etc.)  An instance of this class corresponds to exactly one instance of a node in Houdini."""

Each node has a unique path that defines its location in the tree of nodes.
The node path hierarchy is similar to the hierarchy of folders and files in a
file system.  Some nodes, called networks, may contain other nodes inside them,
much like a file folder would, while other nodes may not.  For example, an
object node instance and a SOP subnetwork node instance may contain SOP nodes,
but a box SOP instance may not.

TIP:
    Be careful not to confuse nodes with node types.  A node is an instance
    of a node type.  For example suppose `/obj/geo1/box1` is a box SOP.  It has
    its own unique name (box1) and its own copies of parameter values.  It is
    an instance of the box SOP node type.  This node type defines what
    parameters are common to all box SOP node instances, as well as the
    algorithm that each BOX SOP performs.  The class that represents a node
    type is [Hom:hou.NodeType].

You cannot create instances of `hou.Node` using `hou.Node.__init__`.
Instead, you look up Node objects corresponding to existing Houdini nodes
with [hou.node()|Hom:hou.node_].  To create a new Houdini node instance inside another
node, use [Hom:hou.Node#createNode].  To delete a Houdini node, use
[Hom:hou.Node#destroy].

Note that a Node object internally stores a reference to the corresponding
Houdini node, and that their lifetimes are different.  If a Python node object
is deleted because its reference count in Python goes to zero, the Houdini node
will be unaffected.  On the other hand, if you have a Node object in a Python
variable and the Houdini node is deleted, the Python variable will still exist,
and Python will not crash.  Instead, if you later call a method on that
Python Node object, Houdini will raise a [Hom:hou.ObjectWasDeleted] exception.

Be careful not to confuse this class with the function [hou.node|Hom:hou.node_].


@methods

== Hierarchy ==

::`node(self, node_path)` -> [Hom:hou.Node] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::node
    #replaces: Cmd:opfind, Exp:chsop, Exp:opexist, Exp:opfullpathfrom
    Return the node at the given path, or None if no such node exists.  If
    you pass in a relative path (i.e. the path does not start with `/`),
    searches are performed relative to this node.

    For example, to get the parent node of a node in the the variable `n`, use
    `n.node("..")`. To get a child node named `geo5`, use `n.node("geo5")`.
    To get a sibling node named `light3`, use `n.node("../light3")`.

    Note that the return value may be an instance of a subclass of Node. For
    example, if the node being found is an object node, the return value
    will be a [Hom:hou.ObjNode] instance.

    If the path is an absolute path (i.e. it starts with `/`), this
    method is a shortcut for `hou.node(node_path)`.  Otherwise, it is
    a shortcut for `hou.node(self.path() + "/" + node_path)`.  See also
    [Hom:hou.node_].

::`nodes(self, node_path_tuple)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::nodes
    
    This is like [node()|#node] but takes multiple paths and returns multiple Node objects. This is the equivalent of:
    
    {{{
    nodes = [self.node(path) for path in paths]
    }}}

::`item(self, item_path)` -> [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::item
    Return the network item at the given path, or None if no such item exists.
    If you pass in a relative path (i.e. the path does not start with `/`),
    searches are performed relative to this node.

    If the path is an absolute path (i.e. it starts with `/`), this
    method is a shortcut for `hou.item(node_path)`.  Otherwise, it is
    a shortcut for `hou.item(self.path() + "/" + item_path)`.  See also
    [Hom:hou.item].

    Note that the return value may be an instance of a subclass of
    NetworkMovableItem. For example, if the item being found is an object node,
    the return value will be a [Hom:hou.ObjNode] instance. If the item is a
    nework box, the return value will be a [Hom:hou.NetworkBox] instance.

::`items(self, item_path_tuple)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::items
    
    This is like [item()|#item] but takes multiple paths and returns multiple NetworkMovableItem objects. This is the equivalent of:
    
    {{{
    items = [self.item(path) for path in paths]
    }}}

::`isNetwork(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isNetwork
    Return `True` if this node is a network, in other words a node that may
    contain child nodes. Otherwise return `False` which indicates that several
    other methods such as [Hom:hou.Node#createNode] will raise
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if they are called.

::`children(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::children
    #replaces: Cmd:opfind, Cmd:opls, Exp:opnchildren
    Return a list of nodes that are children of this node.  Using the file
    system analogy, a node's children are like the contents of a
    folder/directory.

    To find the number of children nodes, use `len(node.children())`.

    The order of the children in the result is the same as the user defined
    ordering in Houdini.  To see this order, switch the network view pane
    into list mode, and ensure that the list order is set to __user defined__.
    To reorder nodes, drag and drop them in the list.

    {{{
    #!python
    def pc(node):
        '''Print the names of the children of a particular node.  This function
           can be handy when working interactively in the Python shell.'''
        for child in node.children():
            print child.name()

    def ls():
        '''Print the names of the nodes under the current node.'''
        pc(hou.pwd())
    }}}

    The following expression evaluates to a list of children of a particular
    node type:
    {{{
    #!python
    [c for c in node.children() if c.type() == node_type]
    }}}

::`allItems(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::allItems
    Return a tuple containing all the children of this node.
    Unlike `children`, this method will also return
    [Hom:hou.NetworkBox], [Hom:hou.SubnetIndirectInput],
    [Hom:hou.StickyNote], and [Hom:hou.NetworkDot] objects.

::`allSubChildren(self, top_down=True)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::allSubChildren
    #replaces: Cmd:oprmtype, Cmd:opfind
    
    Recursively return all sub children of this node.  For example,
    `hou.node("/").allSubChildren()` will return all the nodes in the hip
    file.

    top_down:
        If True, this function will do a top-down traversal, placing a node
        in the returned tuple before its children.  If False, it will do
        a bottom-up traversal, placing children before their parents.

    Note that a tuple is returned, not a generator.  This means that it is
    safe to delete or create nodes while looping through the return value.

    The following function deletes all children of a particular type that
    appear anywhere inside a given node:
    
    {{{
    #!python
    def removeSubChildrenOfType(node, node_type):
        '''Recursively delete all children of a particular type.'''
        for child in node.allSubChildren():
            if child.type() == node_type:
                child.destroy()
    }}}

    This code, for example, removes all the visibility SOPs anywhere under /obj:
    
    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> removeSubChildrenOfType(hou.node("/obj"), hou.sopNodeTypeCategory().nodeTypes()['visibility'])
    }}}

::`allNodes(self)` -> generator of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::allNodes
    Recursively return a sequence of all nodes contained in this node including
    this node.  This method differs from [Hom:hou.Node#allSubChildren] in the
    following ways:
    - It includes this node in the returned sequence.
    - It does not guarantee a top-down or bottom-up traversal order.
    - The method is a generator and does not return a tuple so it is not safe
      to create or delete nodes while looping through the return value.

    Here is an example of printing out the paths for all nodes under /obj:
    {{{
    #!python
    root_node = hou.node("/obj")
    for node in root_node.allNodes():
        print node.path()
    }}}

::`glob(self, pattern, ignore_case=False)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::glob
    #replaces: Cmd:opglob, Cmd:opfind
    Return a tuple of children nodes name matches the pattern.

    The pattern may contain multiple pieces, separated by spaces.  An asterisk
    (`*`) in a pattern piece will match any character.  By default, Houdini
    will add the nodes from each pattern piece to those already matched.
    However, if the pattern piece begins with a caret (`^`), Houdini will
    remove the matches for that piece from the result.

    By default the pattern match is case-sensitive.  Set `ignore_case` to
    True for case-insensitive pattern matching.  Note that case insensitivity
    only applies when matching node names.  It does not apply when matching
    group, network box or bundle names.

    This method returns an empty tuple if you pass in an empty pattern.

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> obj = hou.node("/obj")
    >>> obj.createNode("geo", "geo1")
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/geo1>
    >>> obj.createNode("geo", "geo2")
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/geo2>
    >>> obj.createNode("geo", "grid")
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/grid>
    >>> obj.createNode("geo", "garbage")
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/garbage>
    >>> obj.createNode("geo", "box")
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/box>

    >>> def names(nodes):
    ... return [node.name() for node in nodes]

    >>> names(obj.glob("g*"))
    ['geo1', 'geo2', 'grid', 'garbage']
    >>> names(obj.glob("ge* ga*"))
    ['geo1', 'geo2', 'garbage']
    >>> names(obj.glob("g* ^ga*"))
    ['geo1', 'geo2', 'grid']
    }}}

    See also [Hom:hou.Node#recursiveGlob].

::`recursiveGlob(self, pattern, filter=hou.nodeTypeFilter.NoFilter)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::recursiveGlob
    #replaces: Cmd:opglob, Cmd:opfind
    Like [Hom:hou.Node#glob], return a tuple of children nodes whose name
    matches the pattern.  However, any matching child will have all its children
    added, recursively.  As well, the result may be filtered by node type.

    Houdini first matches children nodes against the pattern, then recursively
    adds the subchildren of matching children, and then applies the filter.

    `pattern`:
        Child node names will be matched against this string pattern.  See
        [Hom:hou.Node#glob] and [Hom:hou.NodeBundle] for information about the
        pattern syntax.  Note that if a child node matches the pattern, all of
        its subchildren will be added to the result (subject to filtering),
        regardless of the pattern.

    `filter`:
        A [Hom:hou.nodeTypeFilter] enumeration value to limit matched nodes
        to a particular type (e.g. object nodes, geometry object nodes,
        surface shader SHOPs, etc.).

    The pattern and filter behavior is very similar to that used by node
    bundles in Houdini.  See [Hom:hou.NodeBundle] for more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the pattern is invalid.


== Adding and removing ==

::`createNode(self, node_type_name, node_name=None, run_init_scripts=True, load_contents=True, exact_type_name=False)` -> [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::createNode
    #replaces: Cmd:opadd
    Create a new node of type `node_type_name` as a child of this node.

    `node_name`:
        The name of the new node. If not specified, Houdini appends a number
        to the node type name, incrementing that number until a unique node
        name is found.  If you specify a name and a node already exists with
        that name, Houdini will append a number to create a unique name.

    `run_init_scripts`:
        If True, the initialization script associated with the node type will
        be run on the new node.

    `load_contents`:
        If True, any subnet contents will be loaded for custom subnet
        operators.

    `exact_type_name`:
        If True, the node's type name will be exactly as specified in the
        `node_type_name`. Otherwise, a preferred operator type that matches
        the given `node_type_name` may be used. For example, the given "hda"
        may match a newer version "hda::2.0", or if there are two available
        operators "namespaceA::hda" and "namespaceB::hda", and the "namespaceB"
        has precedence, then the created node will be of type "namespaceB::hda".

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if this node cannot contain children.
    Raises [Hom:hou.PermissionError] if this node is inside a locked asset.

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> obj = hou.node("/obj")

    # Let Houdini choose a name based on the node type name.
    >>> obj.createNode("geo")
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/geo1>

    # Let Houdini choose a unique name.
    >>> obj.createNode("geo")
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/geo2>

    # Give the node a specific name.
    >>> obj.createNode("geo", "foo")
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/foo>

    # Let Houdini create a unique name from our suggested name.  Also, don't
    # run the geometry object init scripts so the contents are empty.
    >>> obj.createNode("geo", "geo1", run_init_scripts=False)
    <hou.ObjNode of type geo at /obj/geo3>
    >>> obj.node("geo1").children()
    (<hou.SopNode of type file at /obj/geo1/file1>,)
    >>> obj.node("geo3").children()
    ()
    }}}

::`createOrMoveVisualizer(self, output_index)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::createOrMoveVisualizer
    Creates a node for visualizing the data from a particular output of this
    node. If a visualizer node already exists in the current network, it is
    moved and connected to the specified `output_index`. This method is only
    implemented for SOP and VOP nodes. Other node types do nothing when
    this method is called.

::`destroy(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::destroy
    #replaces: Cmd:oprm
    Delete this node.

    If you call methods on a Node instance after it has been destroyed, Houdini
    will raise [Hom:hou.ObjectWasDeleted].

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if you try to delete a node inside a
    locked asset.

::`copyItems(self, items, channel_reference_originals = False, relative_references = True)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::copyItems
    Create copies of all specified items in this network. The items do not
    need to be children of this network, but all items must be contained in
    the same parent network.

    If `channel_reference_originals` is True, the parameters of all new nodes
    are set to channel reference the original nodes. If a copied node is a
    sub-network, only the top level node establishes channel references to the
    original. Child nodes inside the sub-network will be simple copies of the
    original child nodes. The `relative_references` parameter controls whether
    the channel references use relative or absolute paths to the source nodes.

    Returns a `tuple` of all the new network items.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if this node cannot contain children.
    Raises [Hom:hou.PermissionError] if this node is inside a locked asset.

::`deleteItems(self, items)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::deleteItems
    Destroys all the items in the provided tuple of
    [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem] objects. This is significantly more efficient
    than looping over the items and calling `destroy()` on each one. It also
    safely handles cases where one object may not be allowed to be deleted
    unless another object is also deleted.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if one or more of the provided items is
    not a child of this node.
    Raises [Hom:hou.PermissionError] if this node is or is inside a locked
    digital asset.


== Selection ==

::`isCurrent(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isCurrent
    #replaces: Cmd:opget, Exp:opflag
    Return a boolean to indicate of the node is the last selected node in its
    network.

    Each network (i.e. node containing children) stores its own list of
    selected nodes, and the last selected node has special meaning.  For
    example, it is the node displayed in unpinned parameter panes.

    See also [Hom:hou.selectedNodes] to get a tuple of all the selected nodes
    in all networks in Houdini.  The last node in this list also has special
    meaning in Houdini, and corresponds to the global current node.

::`setCurrent(self, on, clear_all_selected=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setCurrent
    #replaces: Cmd:opset
    Set or unset this node as the last selected one.

    Each network (i.e. node containing children) stores its own list of
    selected nodes, and the last selected node has special meaning.  For
    example, it is the node displayed in unpinned parameter panes.

    If `on` is True, this node will become the last selected node.  If it
    is False and this node was the last selected one, it will be unselected
    and the second-last selected node will become the last selected node.

    If `clear_all_selected` is true, Houdini will unselect every node in
    this network before performing the operation.

    See also [Hom:hou.Node#setSelected] and [Hom:hou.selectedNodes].

::`selectedChildren(self, include_hidden=False, include_hidden_support_nodes=False)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::selectedChildren
    #replaces: Cmd:opget
    Return a tuple containing the children of this node that are selected.
    Note that the last selected node has special meaning, and can also be
    retrieved with [Hom:hou.Node#isCurrent].

    `include_hidden`:
        If False, hidden nodes are not included in the result, even if they
        are selected.

    `include_hidden_support_nodes`:
        If True, include in the returned tuple any hidden nodes that exist
        solely to support nodes that are actually selected. This specifically
        refers to VOP Parameter nodes, but may include other support nodes
        as well.

    The following example will print the names of all selected objects in
    `/obj`:
    {{{
    #!python
    for n in hou.node("/obj").selectedChildren():
        print n.name()
    }}}

    To find the total number of selected children nodes, use
    `len(node.selectedChildren())`.

::`selectedItems(self, include_hidden=False, include_hidden_support_nodes=False)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::selectedItems
    Return a tuple containing the children of this node that are selected.
    Unlike `selectedChildren`, this method will also return any selected
    [Hom:hou.NetworkBox], [Hom:hou.SubnetIndirectInput],
    [Hom:hou.StickyNote], and [Hom:hou.NetworkDot] objects.

    `include_hidden`:
        If False, hidden nodes are not included in the result, even if they
        are selected. Other network item types cannot be hidden, and so are
        unaffected by the value of this parameter.

    `include_hidden_support_nodes`:
        If True, include in the returned tuple any hidden nodes that exist
        solely to support nodes that are actually selected. This specifically
        refers to VOP Parameter nodes, but may include other support nodes
        as well.

    The following example will print the positions of all selected items in
    `/obj`:
    {{{
    #!python
    for n in hou.node("/obj").selectedItems():
        print n.position()
    }}}

::`numItems(self, item_type=None, selected_only=False, include_hidden=False)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::numSelectedItems
    Return the number of children of this node that are selected and are of
    the type specified by `item_type`.

    `item_type`:
        If `None`, the total number of selected items of any type is returned.
        If a [Hom:hou.networkItemType] value is provided, the number of
        selected items of that type is returned.

    `selected_only`:
        If `True`, only selected items are counted.

    `include_hidden`:
        If `False`, hidden nodes are not included in the result, even if they
        are selected. Other network item types cannot be hidden, and so are
        unaffected by the value of this parameter.


== Types ==

::`type(self)` -> [Hom:hou.NodeType]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::type
    #replaces: Cmd:optype, Exp:optype
    Return the [Hom:hou.NodeType] object for this node.

    For example, all camera node instances share the same node type.

::`changeNodeType(self, new_node_type, keep_name=True, keep_parms=True, keep_network_contents=True, force_change_on_node_type_match=False)` -> [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::changeNodeType
    #replaces: Cmd:opchangetype
    Changes the node to a new type (within the same context). `new_node_type`
    is the internal string name of the type you want to change to.

    `Keep_name`, `keep_parms`, and `keep_network_contents` indicate that the
    node should keep the same name, parameter values, and contents,
    respectively, after its type has changed.  `force_change_on_node_type_match`
    indicates whether to perform the change even when is already of the
    specified type.

::`childTypeCategory(self)` -> [Hom:hou.NodeTypeCategory]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::childTypeCategory
    Return the [Hom:hou.NodeTypeCategory] corresponding to the children of
    this node.  For example, if this node is a geometry object, the children
    are SOPs.  If it is an object subnet, the children are objects.


== Parameters ==

::`parm(self, parm_path)` -> [Hom:hou.Parm] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::parm
    #replaces: Exp:chexist
    Return the parameter at the given path, or `None` if the parameter
    doesn't exist.

::`globParms(self, pattern, ignore_case=False)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Parm]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::globParms
    #replaces: Cmd:chls
    Return a tuple of parameters matching the pattern.

    The pattern may contain multiple pieces, separated by spaces.  An asterisk
    (`*`) in a pattern piece will match any character.  By default, Houdini
    will add the parameters from each pattern piece to those already matched.
    However, if the pattern piece begins with a caret (`^`), Houdini will
    remove the matches for that piece from the result.

    By default the pattern match is case-sensitive.  Set `ignore_case` to
    True for case-insensitive pattern matching.  Note that case insensitivity
    only applies when matching node and parameter names.  It does not apply
    when matching group, network box or bundle names.

    This method returns an empty tuple if you pass in an empty pattern.

::`evalParm(self, parm_path)` -> `int`, `float`, or `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::evalParm
    #replaces: Exp:ch, Exp:chs
    Evaluates the specified parameter and returns the result.

::`parms(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Parm]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::parms
    #replaces: Cmd:opparm
    Return a list of the parameters on this node.

::`parmsReferencingThis(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Parm]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::parmsReferencingThis
    Return a list of the parameters that reference this node.

::`allParms(self)` -> generator of [Hom:hou.Parm]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::allParms
    Recursively return a sequence of all the parameters on all of the nodes
    contained in this node including this node.

    This method is a generator and does not return a tuple.

    Here is an example of printing out the parameter paths for all nodes under /obj:
    {{{
    #!python
    root_node = hou.node("/obj")
    for parm in root_node.allParms():
        print parm.path()
    }}}

::`setParms(self, parm_dict)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setParms
    Given a dictionary mapping parm names to values, set each of the
    corresponding parms on this node to the given value in the dictionary.

    The following example sets the `tx` and `sy` parameters at once:
    {{{
    #!python
    >>> node = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo")
    >>> node.setParms({"tx": 1, "sy": 3})
    }}}

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if any of the parameter names are not
    valid.

    See also the [setParmExpressions|Hom:hou.Node#setParmExpressions] method.

::`setParmsPending(self, parm_dict)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setParmsPending
    Given a dictionary mapping parm names to values, sets the pending value of
    each of the corresponding parms on this node.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if any of the parameter names are not
    valid.

    See also the [setPending|Hom:hou.Parm#setPending] method.

::`setParmExpressions(self, parm_dict, language=None, replace_expressions=True)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setParmExpressions
    Given a dictionary mapping parm names to expression strings, set each of
    the corresponding parms on this node to the given expression string in
    the dictionary.

    See [Hom:hou.Parm#setExpression] for a description of the `language` and
    `replace_expressions` parms.

    The following example expressions set the `tx` and `sy` parameters at once:
    {{{
    #!python
    >>> node = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo")
    >>> node.setParmExpressions({"tx": 'ch("ty")', "sy": "sin($F)"})
    }}}

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if any of the parameter names are not
    valid.

    See also the [setParms|Hom:hou.Node#setParms] method.

::`parmTuple(self, parm_path)` -> [Hom:hou.ParmTuple] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::parmTuple
    Return the parm tuple at the given path, or `None` if it doesn't exist.

    This method is similar to `parm()`, except it returns a
    [Hom:hou.ParmTuple] instead of a [Hom:hou.Parm].

::`evalParmTuple(self, parm_path)` -> `tuple` of `int`, `float`, or `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::evalParmTuple
    Evaluates the specified parameter tuple and returns the result.

::`parmTuples(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.ParmTuple]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::parmTuples
    Return a list of all parameter tuples on this node.

    This method is similar to `parms()`, except it returns a list of
    [Hom:hou.ParmTuple] instead of [Hom:hou.Parm].

::`parmsInFolder(self, folder_names)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Parm]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::parmsInFolder
    Return a list of parameters in a folder on this node.  Returns all
    parameters in the folder and its subfolders (if any).

    folder_names:
        A sequence of folder name strings.  For example, to get a list of the
        parameters in the Shading folder of the Render folder, use
        `("Render", "Shading")`.  Note that by folder name, we mean the label
        used in the parameter dialog, not the internal parameter name.

        If this sequence is empty, the method returns all parameters on the
        node, the same as if you called `parms()`.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the folder specified by `folder_names`
    does not exist.

    For example, suppose a node had a Render folder that contained a Shading
    subfolder.  Then this line of code would return the parameters in the
    Render folder:
    {{{
    #!python
    # Note the trailing comma after "Render" to tell Python that "Render" is
    # contained in a tuple/sequence as opposed to just a single string with
    # parentheses around it.
    >>> node.parmsInFolder(("Render", ))
    }}}

    And this line of code would return the parameters in the Shading subfolder.
    {{{
    #!python
    >>> node.parmsInFolder(("Render", "Shading"))
    }}}

    and [Hom:hou.Parm#containingFolderSetParmTuples]

::`parmTuplesInFolder(self, folder_names)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.ParmTuple]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::parmTuplesInFolder

    Return a list of the parameter tuples in a folder on this node.
    This method is similar to `parmsInFolder()`, except it returns a list of
    [Hom:hou.ParmTuple] instead of [Hom:hou.Parm]. See `parmsInFolder()`
    above for information about the arguments.

    See also [Hom:hou.Parm#containingFolders]
    and [Hom:hou.Parm#containingFolderSetParmTuples]

::`expressionLanguage(self)` -> [Hom:hou.exprLanguage] enum value:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::expressionLanguage
    Return the node's default expression language.

    When you enter an expression in a parameter that does not already contain
    an expression, the node's expression language is used to determine how
    that expression should be evaluated.  You can change a node's expression
    language in the parameter dialog in the GUI.

    Changing the node's expression language will not change the language in
    parameters already containing expressions (i.e. parameters with keyframes).

    Note that if a parameter already contains an expression and you change that
    expression in the GUI, the expression language will not change, regardless
    of the value of the node's expression language. To change the language of an
    existing expression in a parameter from Python, use
    [Hom:hou.Parm#setExpression], as in
    `parm.setExpression(parm.expression(), language)`.

::`setExpressionLanguage(self, language)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setExpressionLanguage
    Set the node's default expression language.
    See `expressionLanguage()` for more information.

::`parmAliases(self, recurse=False)` -> dict of [Hom:hou.Parm] to `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::parmAliases
    #replaces: Cmd:chalias
    Return a dictionary of parameter aliases on the node's parameters.  The
    keys in the dictionary are the parameters that have aliases and the values
    are the alias names.

    recurse:
        Return the parameter aliases for this node _and its children_.

::`clearParmAliases(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::clearParmAliases
    #replaces: Cmd:chalias
    Removes all alias names from parameters on the node.

::`spareParms(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Parm]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::spareParms
    #replaces: Cmd:opspare
    Return a list of the spare (user-defined) parameters on this node.

::`removeSpareParms(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::removeSpareParms
    #replaces: Cmd:opspareds
    Removes all spare parameters from this node.

::`parmTemplateGroup(self)` -> [Hom:hou.ParmTemplateGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_HDADefinition::parmTemplateGroup
    #replaces: Cmd:opspare
    Return the group of parm templates corresponding to the current parameter
    layout for this node.

    You can edit the parameter layout for this node (add or remove spare
    parameters, reorder or hide built-in parameters, etc.) by getting the
    current parameter group, modifying it, and calling
    [Hom:hou.Node#setParmTemplateGroup] with it.

    The following example creates a geometry object, adds a `My Parms` folder
    to it, and adds a `My Parm` float parameter to it in that folder.  The
    parameters are added only to the geometry object created; other geometry
    objects are unaffected.

    {{{
    #!python
    >>> node = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo")
    >>> group = node.parmTemplateGroup()
    >>> folder = hou.FolderParmTemplate("folder", "My Parms")
    >>> folder.addParmTemplate(hou.FloatParmTemplate("myparm", "My Parm", 1))
    >>> group.append(folder)
    >>> node.setParmTemplateGroup(group)
    }}}

    See [Hom:hou.ParmTemplateGroup] and the
    [setParmTemplateGroup|Hom:hou.Node#setParmTemplateGroup] method for more
    information and examples.

::`setParmTemplateGroup(self, parm_template_group, rename_conflicting_parms=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_HDADefinition::setParmTemplateGroup
    #replaces: Cmd:opspare
    Change the spare parameters for this node.

    `parm_template_group`:
        A [Hom:hou.ParmTemplateGroup] object containing the new parameter
        layout.

    `rename_conflicting_parms`:
        If `True`, parameters in the group with the same parm tuple names will
        be automatically renamed.  If `False` and there are parms with the same
        name, this method raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].

    Note that each node type has a set of parameters which must exist and
    must be of certain types.  If your parm template group does not contain
    the required parameters for the node type the will be added at the
    bottom and will be made invisible.  Similarly, if your parm template
    group attempts to modify the type, range, label, or other property of
    a required parameter, all changes to that parameter other than visibility
    settings will be ignored.

    This method is preferred over the other parameter-related methods in this
    class (addSpareParmTuple, removeSpareParmTuple, replaceSpareParmTuple,
    addSpareParmFolder, removeSpareParmFolder) because it lets you more easily
    make manipulate parameters.

    See [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#setParmTemplateGroup] to change the parameter
    interface of a digital asset.

::`addSpareParmTuple(self, parm_template, in_folder=(), create_missing_folders=False)` -> [Hom:hou.ParmTuple]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::addSpareParmTuple
    #replaces: Cmd:opspare
    Add a spare parameter tuple to the end of the parameters on the node.  If
    `in_folder` is not an empty sequence, this method adds the parameters to
    the end of the parameters in a particular folder.

    parm_template:
        A [Hom:hou.ParmTemplate] subclass instance that specifies the type
        of parameter tuple, the default value, range, etc.

    in_folder:
        A sequence of folder names specifying which folder will hold the
        parameter.  If this parameter is an empty sequence (e.g. `()`), Houdini
        will not put the parameter inside a folder.  If it is, for example,
        `("Misc", "Controls")`, Houdini puts it inside the "Controls" folder
        that's inside the "Misc" folder.  If it is, for example, `("Misc",)`,
        Houdini puts it inside the "Misc" folder.

    create_missing_folders:
        If True, and the folder location specified by `in_folder` does not
        exist, this method creates the missing containing folders.

    Note that this method can add a single folder by passing a
    [Hom:hou.FolderParmTemplate] for `parm_template`.

    See also the `removeSpareParmTuple()` and `addSpareParmFolder()` methods.

    This method is deprecated in favor of `setParmTemplateGroup`.

::`removeSpareParmTuple(self, parm_tuple)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::removeSpareParmTuple
    Removes the specified spare parameter tuple.

    See also `addSpareParmTuple()`.

    This method is deprecated in favor of `setParmTemplateGroup`.

::`addControlParmFolder(self, folder_name=None, parm_name=None)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::addControlParmFolder
    Adds a control parameter folder as the front-most folder at the top-level.
    This is used to increase visibility of customized control parameters. If a 
    folder of the same name already exists, no new folder will be created.
    If folder_name is None, it will be set as 'Controls'. If parm_name is None,
    it will be set as 'folder'.

    If there are no current folders present, the existing parameters will be
    grouped together and stored into a new folder named 'Parameters' and placed
    after the new control parameter folder.

::`addSpareParmFolder(self, folder_name, in_folder=(), parm_name=None, create_missing_folders=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::addSpareParmFolder
    Adds a folder to the spare parameters.

    Note that all the folders in a set correspond to one parameter.  If this
    is the first folder to go in the set, parm_name will be used as the
    parameter name.  Otherwise, parm_name will be ignored and the parameter
    name of the first folder in the set is used.

    If this is the first folder in the set and parm_name is None, it will
    default to 'sparefolder0'.  If parm_name is already in use, a unique name
    will be automatically generated.

    If `create_missing_folders` is True, this method will create the folders in
    in_folder that don't exist. So, this method can be used to add spare folders
    and a spare parameter at the same time.

    Note that you can add folders by passing a [Hom:hou.FolderParmTemplate]
    to the `addSpareParmTuple` method, so this method is deprecated.  Note
    also that `addSpareParmTuple` is deprecated in favor of
    `setParmTemplateGroup`.

    See also the `removeSpareParmFolder` and `addSpareParmTuple` methods.

    This method is deprecated in favor of `setParmTemplateGroup`.

::`removeSpareParmFolder(self, folder)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::removeSpareParmFolder
    Removes an empty folder from the spare parameters.

    `folder` is a sequence of folder names.  So, to remove
    the Output folder, use `("Output",)` instead of `"Output"`.

    See also `addSpareParmFolder()`, [Hom:hou.ParmTemplateGroup#remove], and
    [Hom:hou.ParmTemplateGroup#findFolder].

::`replaceSpareParmTuple(self, parm_tuple_name, parm_template)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::replaceSpareParmTuple
    Replace an existing spare parameter tuple with a new one.  The old
    parameter tuple is removed and the new one is added in its place.

    parm_tuple_name:
        The name of the spare parameter tuple to replace.  Raises
        [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no parameter tuple exists with this name,
        or if it is the name of a non-spare parameter.

    parm_template:
        A [Hom:hou.ParmTemplate] describing the new parameter tuple.

    The new parameter tuple may or may not have the same name as the old one.
    By providing a parameter tuple with the same name, you can modify an
    existing spare parameter tuple.

    Note that you cannot replace non-spare parameter tuples.  However, you can
    change the visibility of non-spare parameters using
    [Hom:hou.ParmTuple#hide].

    To change a parameter for all instances of digital asset, use
    [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#replaceParmTuple].

    This method is deprecated in favor of `setParmTemplateGroup`.

::`localVariables(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::localVariables()
    Return a list of local variables that can be referenced in parameter
    expressions on this node.

::`inputs(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::inputs
    #replaces: Cmd:opgetinput, Exp:opinputs, Exp:opninputs, Exp:icl, Exp:icn, Exp:icr, Exp:ics
    Return a tuple of the nodes connected to this node's inputs. If an input
    is connected to a [Hom:hou.SubnetIndirectInput], the node connected to the
    corresponding input on the parent subnet is returned. In other words the
    presence of the indirect input is hidden. This means the resulting nodes
    may not all be siblings of the calling node.

    If a particular input is not connected (or is connected to an indirect
    input and the corresponding subnet parent input is not connected), a
    `None` value is placed in the tuple at that location.

::`outputs(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::outputs
    #replaces: Exp:opoutput, Cmd:opdepend, Exp:opnoutputs
    Return a tuple of the nodes connected to this node's outputs.

    This method is a shortcut for `[connection.inputNode() for connection in
    self.outputConnections()]`.

::`inputConnections(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NodeConnection]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::inputConnections
    #replaces: Cmd:opgetinput
    Returns a tuple of [Hom:hou.NodeConnection] objects for the connections
    coming into the top of this node. The tuple will have a length equal to
    the number of connections coming into the node.  Returns an empty tuple
    if nothing is connected to this node.

    To get a list of the connected nodes themselves, use [Hom:hou.Node#inputs].
    To get a list of all possible connection sites (whether or not anything
    is connected to them), use [Hom:hou.Node#inputConnectors].

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> cookie = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo").createNode("cookie")
    >>> cookie.setInput(1, cookie.parent().createNode("box"))

    >>> cookie.inputConnectors()
    ((), (<hou.NodeConnection from grid1 output 0 to cookie input 1>,))
    }}}

    See also [Hom:hou.Node#inputConnectors].

::`outputConnections(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NodeConnection]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::outputConnections 
    Return a tuple of NodeConnection objects for the connections going out of
    the bottom of this node.  If nothing is wired into the output of this
    node, return an empty tuple.

    To get a list of the connected nodes themselves, use
    [Hom:hou.Node#outputs].

    Note that this method is a shortcut for: `reduce(lambda a, b: a+b,
    self.outputConnectors(), ())`.  Since most nodes have only one output
    connector, though, this method is usually equivalent to
    `self.outputConnectors()[0]`.

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> box = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo").createNode("box")
    >>> box.parent().createNode("xform").setFirstInput(box)

::`inputConnectors(self)` -> `tuple` of `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NodeConnection]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::inputConnectors
    #replaces: Cmd:opdepend, Cmd:opgetinput, Exp:opinput
    Return a tuple of tuples of [Hom:hou.NodeConnection] objects.  The length
    of the result tuple is equal to the maximum number of inputs that can be
    connected to this node.  Each subtuple contains exactly one node
    connection if something is wired into the connector; otherwise it is the
    empty tuple.

    See also [Hom:hou.NodeConnection] and [Hom:hou.Node#inputConnections].

::`outputConnectors(self)` -> `tuple` of `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NodeConnection]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::outputConnectors
    #replaces: Exp:opgetinput, Exp:opninputs, Exp:icl, Exp:icn, Exp:icr, Exp:ics, Cmd:opdepend
    Return a a tuple of tuples of [Hom:hou.NodeConnection] objects.  The length
    of the result tuple is equal to the number of output connectors on this
    node.  Each subtuple contains all the connections going out of that
    connector, and is empty if nothing is wired to that connector.

::`indirectInputs(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.SubnetIndirectInput]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::indirectInputs
    #replaces: Cmd:opdepend
    Return the hou.SubnetIndirectInput objects of a subnet.

    Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidNodeType] if this node is not a subnetwork.

::`inputAncestors(self, include_ref_inputs=True, follow_subnets=False)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::inputAncestors
    Return a tuple of all input ancestors of this node.  If include_ref_inputs
    is False, then reference inputs are not traversed.  If follow_subnets is
    True, then instead of treating subnetwork nodes as a single node, we also
    traverse its children starting with its display node.

    See also the `inputs()` method.

::`inputIndex(self, input_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::inputIndex
    Obtains an index of a node input that has the given name.

    For the node categories that use input names, it returns the index
    of the input with the given name. For VOP nodes, the name may also be
    a node parameter name that has a corresponding input.

::`outputIndex(self, output_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::outputIndex
    Obtains an index of a node output that has the given name.

    For the node categories that use input names, it returns the index
    of the output with the given name.

::`setInput(self, input_index, item_to_become_input, output_index=0)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setInput
    #replaces: Cmd:opwire, Cmd:opunwire
    If `item_to_become_input` is not None, connect the output connector of
    another node to an input connector of this node.  Otherwise, disconnect
    anything connected to the input connector.

    input_index:
        The index of this node's input connector.

    item_to_become_input:
        If `None` this method disconnects everything from the input connector.
        If a [Hom:hou.Node] or a [Hom:hou.SubnetIndirectInput], this method
        connects its output to this node's input connector.

    output_index:
        The index of the other node's output connector.

    Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidInput] if `output_index` is invalid.  Raises
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if `item_to_become_input` is not in the same
    network as this node.  Raises [Hom:hou.PermissionError] if the node is
    inside a locked asset.

::`setNamedInput(self, input_name, item_to_become_input, output_name_or_index)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setNamedInput
    Connects an output on this node (specified by either an output name or
    an output index) to the input on the item_to_become_input specified by
    input_name.

::`setFirstInput(self, item_to_become_input, output_index=0)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setFirstInput
    #replaces: Cmd:opwire
    A shortcut for `self.setInput(0, item_to_become_input)`.  See
    [Hom:hou.Node#setInput] for more information.

::`setNextInput(self, item_to_become_input, output_index=0, unordered_only=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setNextInput
    #replaces: Cmd:opwire
    Connect the output connector from another node into the first unconnected
    input connector or a multi-input connector of this node. If a node has
    some ordered inputs followed by a multi-input connector, the
    `unordered_only` parameter can be used to force the input to connect to
    the unordered multi-input connection instead of any of the ordered input
    which may not be connected.

    This method is roughly equivalent to:
    {{{
    #!python
    for input_index, conectors in enumerate(self.inputConnectors()):
        if len(connectors) == 0:
            self.setInput(input_index, item_to_become_input, output_index)
        raise hou.InvalidInput("All inputs are connected")
    }}}

    Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidInput] if all inputs are connected.  See
    [Hom:hou.Node#setInput] for more information.

::`insertInput(self, input_index, item_to_become_input, output_index=0)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::insertInput
    Insert an input wire.  In other words, for each input connector after
    input_index, shift the contents of that input connector to the next
    one, and then call [Hom:hou.Node#setInput].  See [Hom:hou.Node#setInput]
    for the meanings of the parameters.

::`numOrderedInputs(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::numOrderedInputs
    Some nodes can have a small number of dedicated inputs with specific
    meanings, followed by an arbitrary number of additional inputs, where
    gaps are not permitted between the inputs (these are referred to as
    unordere inputs). This is common in DOP nodes such as the
    [Multiple Solver DOP|Node:dop/multisolver]. This function returns the
    number of dedicated (or ordered) inputs that occur before the unordered
    inputs begin. This function will only return non-zero valus if the
    [Hom:hou.NodeType#hasUnorderedInputs] function for this node's
    [Hom:hou.Node#type] object returns `True`.

::`createInputNode(self, input_index, node_type_name, node_name=None, run_init_scripts=True, load_contents=True, bool exact_type_name=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::createInputNode
    Create a new node and connect it to one of this node's inputs.  Return the
    new node.

    input_index:
        The index of this node's input connector.
    node_type_name:
        The name of the type of node to create.  See the
        [createNode|Hom:hou.Node#createNode] method for more information.

    Create a new node and connect its first input to this node's (first) output.
    Return the new node.

    See the [createNode|Hom:hou.Node#createNode] method for more information
    on the parameters.

    See also the [createInputNode|Hom:hou.Node#createInputNode] method.

::`inputNames(self)` -> tuple of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::inputNames
    Returns a tuple of all input names for this node. Names for input
    connectors that are hidden are also included.

::`inputLabels(self)` -> tuple of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::inputLabels
    Returns a tuple of all input labels for this node. Labels for input
    connectors that are hidden are also included.

::`outputNames(self)` -> tuple of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::outputNames
    Returns a tuple of all output names for this node.

::`outputLabels(self)` -> tuple of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::outputLabels
    Returns a tuple of all output labels for this node.


== Dependencies ==

::`references(self, include_children = True)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::references
    Return a tuple of nodes that are referenced by this node, either through
    parameter expressions, referring to the node by name, or using expressions
    which rely on the data generated by another node. These reflect all the
    other ways (besides connecting to an input) in which one node may affect
    another.

    Note that the result can differ depending last cook of the nodes. It's 
    recommended that you first call cook() on the node first.

::`dependents(self, include_children = True)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::dependents
    Return a tuple of nodes that are reference this node, either through
    parameter expressions, referring to the node by name, or using expressions
    which rely on the data generated by this node. These reflect all the
    other ways (besides connecting to an input) in which one node may affect
    another.

    Note that the result can differ depending last cook of the nodes.

== Subnets ==

::`isSubNetwork(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isEditableInsideLockedHDA
    Return True if the node is a sub-network and False otherwise.

::`collapseIntoSubnet(self, child_nodes, subnet_name=None, subnet_type=None)` -> [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::collapseIntoSubnet
    #replaces: Cmd:opcollapse
    Given a sequence of children nodes of this node, collapse them into a
    subnetwork.  In other words, create a subnet inside this node's network
    and move the specified children of this network inside that subnet.

    child_nodes:
        The children nodes of this node that will go in the new subnet.

    subnet_name:
        The name for the new subnet node, or None if you want Houdini to
        automatically choose a name.

    subnet_name:
        The type for the new subnet node, or None if you want Houdini to
        automatically choose a primary subnetwork type, which is recommended.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if a node inside `child_nodes` is not
    a child of this network, or if `child_nodes` is an empty sequence.

    This example function takes a single node and replaces it with a subnet,
    moving the node into the subnet..
    {{{
    #!python
    def collapseSingleNodeIntoSubnet(node, subnet_name=None):
        node.parent().collapseIntoSubnet((node,), subnet_name=None)
    }}}

::`extractAndDelete(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::extractAndDelete
    #replaces: Cmd:opextract
    Move the children of this subnet node to become siblings of this node, and
    then delete this node.  The method is the opposite of
    `collapseIntoSubnet()`. Returns a tuple containing all extracted items.

    Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidNodeType] if this node is not a subnetwork.


== Assets ==

::`canCreateDigitalAsset(self)` -> bool:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::canCreateDigitalAsset
    Return `True` if [Hom:hou.Node#createDigitalAsset] can succeed.

::`createDigitalAsset(self, name=None, hda_file_name=None, description=None, min_num_inputs=None, max_num_inputs=None, compress_contents=False, comment=None, version=None, save_as_embedded=False, ignore_external_references=False, change_node_type=True, create_backup=True)` -> `Node`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::createDigitalAsset
    Create a digital asset from this node.  You would typically call this
    method on subnet nodes.

    name:
        The name of the node type that the new digital asset will define.

    hda_file_name:
        The name of the hda file where Houdini will save the digital asset.
        If `None` Houdini will use `$HOME/houdiniX.Y/hda/OPcustom.hda`.

    description:
        The name that will appear in the tab menu.  If None, Houdini will use
        the name for the description.

    min_num_inputs:
        The minimum number of inputs that need to be wired into instances of
        the digital asset.  See [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#minNumInputs] for more
        information.

    max_num_inputs:
        The number of input connectors available on instances of the digital
        asset for input connections.  See [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#minNumInputs]
        for more information.

    compress_contents:
        Whether or not the contents of this digital asset are compressed inside
        the hda file.  See [Hom:hou.HDAOptions#compressContents] for more
        information.

    comment:
        A user-defined comment string.  See [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#comment]
        for more information.

    version:
        A user-defined version string.  See [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#version]
        for more information.

    save_as_embedded:
        Whether or not the digital asset's definition will be saved with the
        hip file instead of an hda file.  When this parameter is True, Houdini
        ignores the `hda_file_name` parameter.  Setting this parameter to True
        is equivalent to setting this parameter to False and setting the
        `hda_file_name` parameter to "Embedded".

    ignore_external_references:
        If True, Houdini will not generate warnings if the contents of this
        digital asset reference nodes outside the asset.

    change_node_type:
        Normally, Houdini will change the node creating the digital asset into
        the new digital asset type.  Setting this flag to false will cause the
        node to remain unchanged.

    create_backup:
        Create a backup before modifying an existing hda file.

::`createCompiledDigitalAsset(self, name=None, hda_file_name=None, description=None)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::createCompiledDigitalAsset
    #replaces: Cmd:otcreatecompiledtypefrom
    Create a compiled digital asset from this node.  You would typically call
    this method on vop network nodes, such as Material Shader Builder SHOP,
    Surface Shader Builder SHOP, or VEX Surface SHOP Type VOPNET. The digital asset
    does not have contents section, which means it does not have vop network inside,
    but instead relies on the saved VEX code sections to provide the shader code.

    After the creation of a compiled HDA, if its VEX code section is ever
    changed manually, the corresponding vex object code section can be
    recompiled using [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#compileCodeSection].

    name:
        The name of the node type that the new digital asset will define.

    hda_file_name:
        The name of the hda file where Houdini will save the digital asset.
        If `None` Houdini will use `$HOME/houdiniX.Y/hda/OPcustom.hda`.

    description:
        The name that will appear in the tab menu.  If None, Houdini will use
        the name for the description.


::`allowEditingOfContents(self, propagate=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::allowEditingOfContents
    #replaces: Cmd:otsync
    Unlocks a digital asset so its contents can be edited.

    To use this function, you must have permission to modify the HDA.

::`matchCurrentDefinition(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::matchCurrentDefinition
    #replaces: Cmd:otsync
    If this node is an unlocked digital asset, change its contents to match
    what is stored in the definition and lock it.  The parameter values are
    unchanged.

    If this node is locked or is not a digital asset, this method has no
    effect.

    See also [Hom:hou.Node#matchesCurrentDefinition] and
    [Hom:hou.Node#isLocked].

::`matchesCurrentDefinition(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::matchesCurrentDefinition
    #replaces: Cmd:otsync
    Return whether the contents of the node are locked to its type definition.

::`isLockedHDA(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isLockedHDA
    If this node is an instance of a digital asset, return whether or not it
    is locked.  Otherwise, return False.

    To differentiate between unlocked digital assets and nodes that are
    not instances of digital assets, check if the node's type has a definition:
    {{{
    #!python
    def isUnlockedAsset(node):
        return not node.isLockedHDA() and node.type().definition() is not None
    }}}

    See [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#updateFromNode] for an example of how to
    save and lock all unlocked digital asset instances.

::`isInsideLockedHDA(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isInsideLockedHDA
    Return whether this node is inside a locked digital asset.  If this node is
    not inside a locked HDA, the node may deviate from the HDA definition.

::`isEditableInsideLockedHDA(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isEditableInsideLockedHDA
    Return True if the node is an editable node contained inside a locked HDA
    node and False otherwise. In particular this function will return False
    for a node that is not inside a locked HDA.

::`isEditable(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isEditable
    Return True if the node is editable. This is similar to the
    [Hom:hou.Node#isEditableInsideLockedHDA] method except that it will return
    True for nodes that are not inside a locked HDA. This function is the
    simplest way to determine if most node modifications (changing inputs,
    changing parameters, changing flags) will be allowed on the node.

::`hdaModule(self)` -> [Hom:hou.HDAModule]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::hdaModule
    This method is a shortcut for `self.type().hdaModule() to reduce the length
    of expressions in Python parameters and button callbacks.  See
    [Hom:hou.NodeType#hdaModule] for more information.

    See also the `hm` method and [Hom:hou.phm].

::`hm(self)` -> [Hom:hou.HDAModule]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::hdaModule
    This method is a shortcut for `self.hdaModule()`.

    See also [Hom:hou.phm].

::`syncNodeVersionIfNeeded(self, from_version)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::syncNodeVersionIfNeeded
    Synchronize the node from the specified version to the current version of
    its HDA definition. See also [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#version].


== Metadata ==

::`comment(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::comment
    #replaces: Cmd:opcomment
    Return the node's comment string.

::`setComment(self, comment)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setComment
    #replaces: Cmd:opcomment
    Sets the comment associated with this node.
    See also `appendComment()`.

::`appendComment(self, comment)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::appendComment
    #replaces: Cmd:opcomment
    Appends the given text to the comment associated with this node.

::`isDisplayDescriptiveNameFlagSet(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isDisplayDescriptiveNameFlagSet
    #replaces: Cmd:opget, Exp:opflag
    Return a boolean to indicate of the node should display its
    descriptive name in the network editor.

::`setDisplayDescriptiveNameFlag(self, on)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setDisplayDescriptiveName
    #replaces: Cmd:opset
    Set or unset whether this node should display its descriptive
    name in the network editor.

::`creationTime(self)` -> `datetime.datetime`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::creationTime
    #replaces: Cmd:opstat
    Return the date and time when the node was created.

::`modificationTime(self)` -> `datetime.datetime`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::modificationTime
    #replaces: Cmd:opstat
    Return the date and time when the node was last modified.

::`creator(self)` -> Node:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::creator
    #replaces: Cmd:opstat
    #status: nd

::`creatorState(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::creatorState
    This returns the name of the viewport tool that was used to be created.
    This name is not set by default and is usually the empty string.

::`setCreatorState(self, state)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setCreatorState
    This sets the name of the tool that created this node. If you call this
    with a name that differs from the node type name, you should also call
    `setBuiltExplicitly(False)`.

::`isBuiltExplicitly(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::creator
    Return whether this node was built explicitly (defaults to True).  Most
    nodes are built explicitly, but some are implicitly created by Houdini.
    For example, if you select geometry from multiple SOPs and then perform
    an operation, Houdini will put down an implicit merge SOP before performing
    that operation.  When reselecting geometry in SOPs, Houdini will
    automatically delete any SOPs that were created implicitly.

::`setBuiltExplicitly(self, built_explicitly)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setBuiltExplicitly()
    Set whether this node was built explicitly (default value is True). If
    set to False, this node will not show up in various menus and in the
    Network View pane's list mode. This flag is typically used for
    intermediate utility nodes that one is unlikely to want to change its
    parameters.

::`isTimeDependent(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isTimeDependent
    Return whether the node is time dependent.  A time dependent node is
    re-evaluated every time the frame changes.


== Layout ==

::`moveToGoodPosition(self, relative_to_inputs=True, move_inputs=True, move_outputs=True, move_unconnected=True)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector2]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::moveToGoodPosition
    #replaces: Cmd:opautoplace
    Moves a node to a well-spaced position near its inputs or outputs and
    returns the new position of the node.

::`layoutChildren(self, child_nodes=(), horizontal_spacing=-1.0, vertical_spacing=-1.0)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::layoutChildren
    #replaces: Cmd:oplayout
    Automatically position all or some children of this node in the network
    editor.

    items:
        A sequence of child [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem] objects to position.
        This may include nodes, dots, and/or subnet inputs. If this sequence
        is empty, this method will reposition all child items of this node.

    horizontal_spacing:
        A fraction of the width and height of a tile that affects the space
        between nodes with common inputs.  If this parameter is -1, Houdini
        uses the default spacing.

    vertical_spacing:
        A fraction of the width and height of a tile that affects the space
        between a node and its output nodes.  If this parameter is -1, Houdini
        uses the default spacing.

::`isHidden(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isHidden
    #replaces: Cmd:opget, Exp:opflag
    Return whether the node is hidden in the network editor.  Note that Houdini
    also uses the term "exposed" to refer to nodes that are not hidden.

    If a visible node is connected to a hidden node, the network editor will
    display dashed lines for the wire going from the visible node to the hidden
    node.

    See also [Hom:hou.Node#hide].

::`hide(self, on)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::hide
    #replaces: Cmd:opset
    Hide or show a node in the network editor.  See [Hom:hou.Node#isHidden]
    for more information about hidden nodes.


== Cooking ==

::`cook(self, force=False, frame_range=())`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::cook
    #replaces: Cmd:opcook
    Asks or forces the node to re-cook.

    frame_range:
        The frames at which to cook the object. This should be a tuple of 2 or 3
        ints giving the start frame, end frame, and optionally a frame
        increment, in that order. If you supply a two-tuple `(start, end)`, the
        increment is `1`.

::`needsToCook(self, time=hou.time())` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::needsToCook
    Asks if the node needs to re-cook.

::`cookCount(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::cookCount()
    Returns the number of times this node has cooked in the current session.

::`updateParmStates(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::updateParmStates()
    Update the UI states, such as hidden and disabled, for each parameter
    in the node.
    
    UI states can be expressed as conditionals (i.e. Disable
    When) which require evaluation.  Typically in graphical Houdini the
    Parameter Pane performs the evaluation when the node is selected in order
    to determine how the node parameters should look in the pane.  However in
    non-graphical Houdini or if the Parameter Pane has not yet loaded the node,
    then the evaluation does not occur and the UI states remain at their
    defaults causing methods such as [Hom:hou.Parm#isDisabled] and
    [Hom:hou.Parm#isHidden] to return incorrect values.  In these cases, it
    is recommended that [Hom:hou.Node#updateParmStates] is called.

::`errors(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::errors
    Return the text of any errors from the last cook of this node,
    or an empty tuple if there were no errors.

::`warnings(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::warnings
    Return the text of any warnings from the last cook of this node,
    or an empty tuple if there were no warnings.

::`messages(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::messages
    Return the text of any messages from the last cook of this node,
    or an empty tuple if there were no messages.

::`infoTree(self, verbose=False, debug=False)` -> [Hom:hou.NodeInfoTree]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::infoTree
    #replaces: Cmd:opinfo
    Returns a tree structure containing information about the node and its
    most recently cooked data. The contents of the tree vary widely depending
    on the node type, and the nature of its cooked data. This tree of data is
    used to generate the node information window contents.

    Setting `verbose` to `True` will cause some additional information to be
    generated. In particular data that is expensive to calculate, or which will
    generate a large amount of information tends to be generated only if this
    option is turned on.

    Setting `debug` to `True` will, in a few cases, cause additional
    information to be displayed which generally will be most useful when
    debugging the internal opreation of Houdini. For example, geometry
    attributes will display their "data ids", which can be helpful when
    tracking down errors in SOPs written with the HDK.

::`canGenerateCookCode(self, check_parent=False)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::canGenerateCookCode
    Return True if the node can generate compiled cook code and False otherwise.

    If check_parent is true, the parents in the ancestor hierarchy are tested
    if any of them can generate code.

::`cookCodeGeneratorNode(self, check_parent=False)` -> [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::cookCodeGeneratorNode
    Return the node itself or a network node that contains this node and 
    can generate compiled cook code.  For example, the generator node for 
    a VOP node could be the SHOP node or SOP node that contains it for example.

    Return None if this node cannot generate code and is not contained 
    in a code generating node either either.

::`cookCodeLanguage(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::cookCodeLanguage
    Return the language of the generated cook code (i.e. VEX, RSL).

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if this node cannot generate compiled code.

::`supportsMultiCookCodeContexts(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::supportsMultiCookCodeContexts
    Return True if this node can generate compiled cook code for multiple
    contexts (i.e. surface context, displacement context, etc.) and False otherwise.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if this node cannot generate compiled code.

::`saveCompiledCookCodeToFile(self, file_name, context_name=None)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::saveCompiledCookCodeToFile

    Saves compiled VEX code to a disk file (for nodes that support this).
    See [Hom:hou.Node#saveCookCodeToFile] for a description of the arguments.

::`saveCookCodeToFile(self, file_name, skip_header=False, context_name=None)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::saveCookCodeToFile
    Saves VEX/RSL source code to a disk file (on nodes that support this).

    `file_name`:
        The file path in which to save the generated code.

    `skip_header`:
        If `True`, the method does not write a header comment at the beginning
        of the file containing the file name and node path from which the code
        was generated and a time stamp.

    `context_name`:
        A string containing name of the shader context for the code. This
        option applies to nodes such as the
        [Material Shader Builder|Node:shop/vopmaterial] which can generate
        code for multiple context types.

        For example, a Material network might contain both surface and
        displacement shaders, so you must specify which type of shader code to
        generate:

        {{{
        #!python
        node("/shop/vopmaterial1").saveCookCodeToFile("myfile.vfl", context_name="surface")
        }}}

        On single-context nodes this argument is ignored.

        For VEX materials, possible values are `surface`, `displacement`,
        `light`, `shadow`, `fog`, `image3d`, `photon`, or `cvex`.

        For RSL materials, possible values are `surface`, `displacement`,
        `light`, `volume`, or `imager`.


== Network boxes ==

::`networkBoxes(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.NetworkBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::networkBoxes
    #replaces: Cmd:nbls
    Return a list of the network boxes inside this node.

::`iterNetworkBoxes(self)` -> generator of [Hom:hou.NetworkBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::networkBoxes
    #replaces: Cmd:nbls
    Return a generator that iterates through all the network boxes inside this
    node.

::`findNetworkBox(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.NetworkBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::findNetworkBox
    #replaces: Cmd:nbls
    Return a network box with the given name inside this node, or `None` if
    no network box with the given name exists.

::`findNetworkBoxes(self, pattern)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NetworkBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::findNetworkBoxes
    #replaces: Cmd:nbglob
    Return a list of network boxes inside this node whose names match a
    pattern.

::`createNetworkBox(self, name=None)` -> [Hom:hou.NetworkBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::createNetworkBox
    #replaces: Cmd:nbadd
    Creates a network box inside this network. Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed]
    if this node is not a network.

    If you don't specify a `name`, Houdini gives the box a default name.

    Network box names are not displayed in the network editor pane. Instead, a
    "comment" can be specified with the [Hom:hou.NetworkBox#setComment]
    method, and this comment will appear in the title bar of the network box.

::`copyNetworkBox(self, network_box_to_copy, new_name=None, channel_reference_original=False)` -> [Hom:hou.NetworkBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::copyNetworkBox
    #replaces: Cmd:nbcp
    Copies a network box and returns the copy.

    If `new_name` is given, the network box will be copied to a new network box
    named new_name (a different name will be generated if there is already a
    network box with that name).

    If `channel_reference_original` is `True`, all operators created by the copy
    will have their animatable parameters set to reference the original
    operators.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if this node is not a network or if the
    node child type does not match the network box's node type.


== Sticky notes ==

::`stickyNotes(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.StickyNote]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::stickyNotes
    Return a list of the sticky notes inside this node.

::`iterStickyNotes(self)` -> generator of [Hom:hou.StickyNote]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::stickyNotes
    Return a generator that iterates through all the sticky notes inside this
    node.

::`findStickyNote(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.StickyNote]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::findStickyNote
    Return a sticky note with the given name inside this node, or `None` if
    no sticky note with the given name exists.

::`findStickyNotes(self, pattern)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.StickyNote]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::findStickyNotes
    Return a list of sticky notes inside this node whose names match a
    pattern.

::`createStickyNote(self, name=None)` -> [Hom:hou.StickyNote]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::createStickyNote
    Creates a sticky note inside this network. Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed]
    if this node is not a network.

    If you don't specify a `name`, Houdini gives the note a default name.

::`copyStickyNote(self, network_box_to_copy, new_name=None)` -> [Hom:hou.StickyNote]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::copyStickyNote
    Copies a sticky note and returns the copy.

    If `new_name` is given, the sticky note will be copied to a new sticky note
    named new_name (a different name will be generated if there is already a
    sticky note with that name).

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if this node is not a network or if the
    node child type does not match the sticky note's node type.


== Network dots ==

::`createNetworkDot(self)` -> [Hom:hou.NetworkDot]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::createNetworkDot
    Creates a network dot inside this network. Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed]
    if this node is not a network.

::`networkDots(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NetworkDot]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::networkDots
    Returns a tuple of all dots in this network.


== Node groups ==

::`addNodeGroup(self, name=None)` -> [Hom:hou.NodeGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::addNodeGroup
    #replaces: Cmd:opgadd
    Add a node group to the node and return the new group.

    If a group of the given name already exists then this function simply
    returns the existing group without adding a new one. If the name of the
    group is None or an empty string, then a unique default name is
    automatically chosen.

    This function can only be called on nodes that are networks. If it is called
    on a node that is not a network, then it raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].

    To remove a node group, use [Hom:hou.NodeGroup#destroy].

::`nodeGroup(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.NodeGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::nodeGroup
    #replaces: Cmd:opgls
    Return a node group contained by the node with the given name, or `None` if
    the group does not exist.

::`nodeGroups(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.NodeGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::nodeGroups
    #replaces: Cmd:opgls
    Return the list of node groups in this node.


== Scripts ==

::`runInitScripts(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::runInitScripts
    Runs the initialization script associated with this node's type.

::`deleteScript(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::deleteScript
    #replaces: Cmd:opdelscript
    Return the script that will run when this node is deleted.

::`setDeleteScript(self, script_text, language=hou.scriptLanguage.Python)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setDeleteScript
    Sets the script that will run when this node is deleted.


== Motion FX ==

::`motionEffectsNetworkPath(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::motionEffectsNetworkPath
    Return a node path representing the location for storing clips. This
    location may or may not exist. To find or create such a network, use
    [Hom:hou.Node#findOrCreateMotionEffectsNetwork].

::`findOrCreateMotionEffectsNetwork(self, create=True)` -> [Hom:hou.chopNetNodeTypeCategory]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::findOrCreateMotionEffectsNetwork
    Return a CHOP network node suitable for storing Motion Effects. By
    default, if the node doesn't exist, it will be created.

    See also [Hom:hou.Parm#storeAsClip] and
    [Hom:hou.Node#motionEffectsNetworkPath].


== Stamping ==

::`stampValue(self, parm_name, default_value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::stampValue
    #replaces: Exp:stamp, Exp:stamps
    Return a copy stamping floating point or string value.  This node must be a
    downstream stamping operator, such as a Copy SOP, Cache SOP, LSystem SOP,
    or Copy CHOP.

    `parm_name`:
        The name of the stamping variable.
    `default_value`:
        The value that this function returns if Houdini is not currently
        performing stamping, or if `parm_name` is not a valid variable
        name.  This value may be a float or a string.

    You might put the following expression in a Python parameter:
    {{{
    #!python
    node("../copy1").stampValue("sides", 5)
    }}}


== Serialization ==

::`copyItemsToClipboard(self, items)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::copyItemsToClipboard
    Given a sequence of child items (nodes, network boxes, sticky notes, etc),
    save them to the clipboard so they can be pasted into this or another
    network.

    items:
        A sequence of [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]s that are children of this
        node.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if any of the nodes or network boxes
    are node children of this node.
    Raises [Hom:hou.PermissionError] if you do not have permission to read
    the contents of this node.

::`saveItemsToFile(self, items, file_name, save_hda_fallbacks = False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::saveItemsToFile
    #replaces: Cmd:opwrite
    Given a sequence of child items (nodes, network boxes, sticky notes, etc),
    save a file containing those items.  You can load this file using
    [Hom:hou.Node#loadItemsFromFile].

    items:
        A sequence of [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]s that are children of this
        node.

    file_name:
        The name of the file to write the contents to.  You can use any
        extension for this file name.

    save_hda_fallbacks:
        Set to `True` to save simplified definitions for HDAs into the file
        along with the child nodes. Doing this allows the generated file to
        be safely loaded into any houdini session, even if the assets used
        in the file are not already loaded into the houdini session. Depending
        on the use of the generated file, this information is often not
        required and makes the files unnecessarily large.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if any of the nodes or network boxes
    are node children of this node, or if the file could not be written to.
    Raises [Hom:hou.PermissionError] if you do not have permission to read
    the contents of this node.

::`saveChildrenToFile(self, nodes, network_boxes, file_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::saveChildrenToFile
    #replaces: Cmd:opwrite
    Combines separate lists of nods and network boxes into a single sequence,
    and calls [Hom:hou.Node#saveItemsToFile]. This method is provided for
    backward compatibility. New code should call `saveItemsToFile` directly.

    nodes:
        A sequence of [Hom:hou.Node]s that are children of this node.

    network_boxes:
        A sequence of [Hom:hou.NetworkBox]es that are contained in this node.
        Note that the contents of the network boxes are not automatically
        saved, so it is up to you to put them in the list of nodes.

::`loadItemsFromFile(self, file_name, ignore_load_warnings=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::loadChildrenFromFile
    #replaces: Cmd:opread
    Load the contents of a file saved with [Hom:hou.Node#saveChildrenToFile]
    into the contents of this node.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the file does not exist or it is not
    the correct type of file.  Raises [Hom:hou.PermissionError] if this
    node is a locked instance of a digital asset.  Raises [Hom:hou.LoadWarning]
    if the load succeeds but with warnings and `ignore_load_warnings` is
    `False`.

::`loadChildrenFromFile(self, file_name, ignore_load_warnings=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::loadChildrenFromFile
    #replaces: Cmd:opread
    Calls [Hom:hou.Node#loadItemsFromFile]. Provided for backward
    compatibility. New code should call `loadItemsFromFile` directly.

::`pasteItemsFromClipboard(self, position = None)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::pasteItemsFromClipboard
    Load the contents of a file saved with [Hom:hou.Node#copyItemsToClipboard]
    into the contents of this node. If the `position` parameter is given as a
    tuple of two float values (or equivalent, like a [Hom:hou.Vector2]), the
    pasted items are moved such that they are centered around the provided
    position.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if this node is not a network, or if
    there are errors loading the items from the clipboard. Raises
    [Hom:hou.PermissionError] if this node is a locked instance of a
    digital asset.

::`asCode(self, brief=False, recurse=False, save_channels_only=False, save_creation_commands=True, save_keys_in_frames=False, save_outgoing_wires=False, save_parm_values_only=False, save_spare_parms=True, function_name=None)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::asCode
    #replaces: Cmd:opscript
    Prints the Python code necessary to recreate a node.

    `brief`:
        Do not set values if they are the parameter's default.  Applies to the
        contents of the node if either recurse or save_box_contents is True.

    `recurse`:
        Recursively apply to the entire operator hierarchy.

    `save_box_contents`:
        Script the contents of the node.

    `save_channels_only`:
        Only output channels.  Applies to the contents of the node if either
        recurse or save_box_contents is True.

    `save_creation_commands`:
        Generate a creation script for the node.  If set to False, the
        generated script assumes that the network box already exists.  When set
        to True, the script will begin by creating the network box.

    `save_keys_in_frames`:
        Output channel and key times in samples (frames) instead of seconds.
        Applies to the contents of the node if either recurse or
        save_box_contents is True.

    `save_parm_values_only`:
        Evaluate parameters, saving their values instead of the expressions.
        Applies to the contents of the node if either recurse or
        save_box_contents is True.

    `save_spare_parms`:
        Save spare parameters as well.  When save_creation_commands is True,
        commands for creating spare parameters will also be output.  Applies to
        the contents of the node if either recurse or save_box_contents is
        True.

    `function_name`:
        If a function_name is specified, the output will be wrapped in a Python
        function.


== Operators ==

::`__eq__(self, node)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::operator==(HOM_Node*)
    Implements `==` between `Node` objects.

    For example,  hou.root() == hou.node("/") will return `True`.

    There can be multiple Python `Node` objects for the same Houdini node.
    Two identical calls to `hou.node()` will return different Python `Node`
    objects, with each representing the same Houdini node. Comparing these nodes
    using `==` (which calls `__eq__`) will return `True`, while comparing them
    using `is` (the object identity test) will return `False`.

::`__ne__(self, node)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::operator!=(HOM_Node*)
    Implements `!=` between `Node` objects. See `__eq__()`.


== Callbacks ==

::`addEventCallback(self, event_types, callback)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::addEventCallback
    
    Registers a Python callback that Houdini will call whenever a particular action, or event, occurs on _this particular node instance_.
    
    Callbacks only persist for the current session. For example, they are not saved to the `.hip` file. If you want persistent callbacks in every session, you can add them in code in `456.py` (runs when the user opens a `.hip` file). See [where to add Python scripting|/hom/locations] for more information.

    `event_types`:
        A sequence of [Hom:hou.nodeEventType] enumeration values describing the event types that will cause Houdini to call the `callback` function.

    `callback`:
        A callable Python object, such as a function or bound method. Houdini will call this function whenever one of the event types in `event_types` occurs.
        
        Houdini calls the function with an `event_type` keyword argument containing the [Hom:hou.nodeEventType] value corresponding to the event that triggered the callback.
        
        Houdini will pass additional keyword arguments depending on the event type. For example, in a callback for the `ParmTupleChanged` event, Houdini will pass a `parm_tuple` keyword argument containing a [Hom:hou.ParmTuple] reference to the parameter that changed. See [Hom:hou.nodeEventType] for the extra arguments (if any) passed for each event type.
        
        You can add `**kwargs` to the argument list to accept all keyword arguments, to allow the same callback to be used for different events, or to be safe from future changes:
        
        {{{
        #!python
        def event_callback(event_type, **kwargs):
            ...
        }}}

    NOTE:
        If you try to add the exact same callback function more than once, Houdini will still only call the function only once in response to an event. However, it may be useful to "add" the same function if you want to register it with different `event_types`.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the `event_types` list argument is
    empty.

    The following example shows to set up a function that's called whenever a certain node's name changes:

    {{{
    #!python
    
    def name_changed(node, event_type, **kwargs):
        print("The geometry object is now named", node.name())
    
    hou.node("/obj/geo1").addEventCallback(hou.nodeEventType.NameChanged, name_changed)
    }}}

    See also [Hom:hou.Node#removeEventCallback] and [Hom:hou.Node#removeAllEventCallbacks].

::`removeEventCallback(self, event_types, callback)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::removeEventCallback
    Given a callback that was previously added on this node and a sequence
    of [Hom:hou.nodeEventType] enumerated values, remove those event types from
    the set of event types for the callback.  If the remaining set of event
    types is empty, the callback will be removed entirely from this node.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the callback had not been previously
    added.

    See [Hom:hou.Node#addEventCallback] for more information.

::`removeAllEventCallbacks(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::removeAllEventCallbacks
    Remove all event callbacks for all event types from this node.

    See [Hom:hou.Node#addEventCallback] for more information.

::`eventCallbacks()` -> `tuple` of (`tuple` of [Hom:hou.nodeEventType], callback):
    #cppname: HOM_ui::eventCallbacks
    Return a tuple of all the Python callbacks that have been registered with
    this node with calls to [Hom:hou.Node#addEventCallback].


== User data ==

::`setUserData(self, name, value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setUserData
    
    Add/set a named string on this node instance.

    `name`:
        A unique name (key) for the user-defined data.  By using different
        names, you can attach multiple pieces of user-defined data to a node.
        
    `value`:
        The string to store.

    This name/value pair is stored with the hip file and is included in the
    output from [Cmd:opscript] and [Hom:hou.Node#asCode].

    The following example illustrates how to set, access, and delete
    user-defined data:

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> n = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo")
    >>> n.setUserData("my data", "my data value")
    >>> n.userData("my data")
    'my data value'
    >>> n.userDataDict()
    {'my data': 'my data value'}
    >>> n.destroyUserData("my data")
    >>> n.userDataDict()
    {}
    >>> print n.userData("my data")
    None
    }}}

    See [per-node user-defined data|Hom:nodeuserdata] for more information
    and examples.

::`userDataDict(self, name)` -> `dict` of `str` to `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::userDataDict
    Return a dictionary containing all the user-defined name/string pairs
    for this node.

    See [Hom:hou.Node#setUserData] for more information.

::`userData(self, name)` -> `str` or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::userData
    Return the user-defined data with this name, or `None` if no data with this
    name exists.

    See [Hom:hou.Node#setUserData] for more information.

    This method can be implemented as follows:
    {{{
    #!python
    def userData(self, name):
        return self.userDataDict().get(name)
    }}}

::`destroyUserData(self, name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::destroyUserData
    Remove the user-defined data with this name.

    See [Hom:hou.Node#setUserData] for more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no user data with this name exists.

::`setCachedUserData(self, name, value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setCachedUserData
    Add/set a named value on this node instance.  Unlike `setUserData`,
    values set using this method are not saved with the hip file.

    `name`:
    A unique name (key) for the user-defined data.  By using different
    names, you can attach multiple pieces of user-defined data to a node.
    `value`:
    The value to store.  Unlike `setUserData`, this value may be any Python
    object.

    This name/value pair is not stored with the hip file.  It is useful for
    nodes implemented in Python that want to save temporary values between
    cooks, to avoid recomputing them on subsequent cooks.

    The following example illustrates how to set, access, and delete
    cached user-defined data:

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> n = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo")
    >>> n.setCachedUserData("my data", [1, 2, {"a": "b", "c": "d"}])
    >>> n.cachedUserData("my data")
    [1, 2, {'a': 'b', 'c': 'd'}]
    >>> n.cachedUserDataDict()
    {'my data': [1, 2, {'a': 'b', 'c': 'd'}]}
    >>> n.destroyCachedUserData("my data")
    >>> n.cachedUserDataDict()
    {}
    >>> print n.cachedUserData("my data")
    None
    }}}

    See [per-node user-defined data|Hom:nodeuserdata] for more information
    and examples.

::`cachedUserDataDict(self, name)` -> `dict` of `str` to `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::cachedUserDataDict
    Return a dictionary containing all the user-defined name/string pairs
    for this node.

    See [Hom:hou.Node#setCachedUserData] for more information.

::`cachedUserData(self, name)` -> `str` or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::cachedUserData
    Return the user-defined cached data with this name, or `None` if no data
    with this name exists.

    See [Hom:hou.Node#setCachedUserData] for more information.

    This method can be implemented as follows:
    {{{
    #!python
    def cachedUserData(self, name):
        return self.cachedUserDataDict().get(name)
    }}}

    Note that `None` is a valid value for a key, so the most reliable way to
    check if a key is valid is to check if it is in the result of
    `cachedUserDataDict`:
    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> n = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo")
    >>> n.cachedUserDataDict()
    {}
    >>> print n.cachedUserData("foo")
    None
    >>> "foo" in n.cachedUserDataDict()
    False
    >>> n.setCachedUserData("foo", None)
    >>> n.cachedUserDataDict()
    {'foo': None}
    >>> print n.cachedUserData("foo")
    None
    >>> "foo" in n.cachedUserDataDict()
    True
    }}}

::`destroyCachedUserData(self, name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::destroyCachedUserData
    Remove the user-defined cached data with this name.

    See [Hom:hou.Node#setCachedUserData] for more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no user data with this name exists.


== Dynamics ==

::`simulation(self)` -> [Hom:hou.DopSimulation]:
    #cppname: HOM_DopNetNode::simulation
    Return the simulation defined by this DOP network node.  This raises
    an exception if this is not a dop network.

::`findNodesThatProcessedObject(self, dop_object)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.DopNode]:
    #cppname: HOM_DopNetNode::findNodesThatProcessedObject
    #replaces: Exp:dopnodeobjs
    Given a [Hom:hou.DopObject], return a tuple of DOP nodes that processed
    that object.  This raises an exception if this is not a dopnetwork.


== Flags ==

::`isFlagReadable(self, flag)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isFlagReadable
    Return True if the specified flag is readable and False otherwise.

    `flag` must be a [Hom:hou.nodeFlag] value. 

::`isFlagWritable(self, flag)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isFlagWritable
    Return True if the specified flag is writable and False otherwise.

    `flag` must be a [Hom:hou.nodeFlag] value.

::`isGenericFlagSet(self, flag)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::isGenericFlagSet
    Returns the value of the specific flag.

    `flag` must be a [Hom:hou.nodeFlag] value. 

::`setGenericFlag(self, flag, value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::setGenericFlag
    Sets the value of the specified flag based on the `bool` `value` argument.

    `flag` must be a [Hom:hou.nodeFlag] value.
