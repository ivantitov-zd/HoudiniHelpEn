::`definitionsInFile(file_path)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.HDADefinition]:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::definitionsInFile
    #replaces: Cmd:otglob, Cmd:otls
    Return all the digital asset definitions inside an hda file.  See
    [Hom:hou.HDADefinition] for more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if `file_path` does not refer to a valid
    hda file.

::`installFile(file_path, oplibraries_file=None, change_oplibraries_file=True, force_use_assets=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::installFile
    #replaces: Cmd:otload
    Install all the node types defined in an hda file into the current Houdini
    session.  This function is equivalent to __File > Install Digital Asset
    Library...__ in Houdini.

    file_path:
        The hda file to load.

    oplibraries_file:
        The path to an OPlibraries file or `None`.  OPlibraries files are text
        files containing lists of hda files to load on startup.  When Houdini
        starts up it reads all the OPlibraries files it finds in the Houdini
        path and loads all the hda files listed in them.  By creating
        OPlibraries files in `$HOME/houdiniX.Y`, `$HSITE/houdiniX.Y`, `$JOB`, etc.
        you can create libraries that are specific to a particular user,
        studio, job, etc.

        This parameter is only meaningful when `change_oplibraries_file` is
        `True`.

        Note that OPlibraries are only used when the __Use OPlibraries files to
        find HDAS__ checkbox in the __Configuration__ tab of the __Operator
        Type Manager__ is checked.

        If `None` or "Current HIP File", the hda file is loaded only into the
        current Houdini session.  The file name will also be saved in the Hip
        file so that when the same Hip file is loaded, the hda file will
        also be loaded automatically.

        If "Scanned HDA Directories", this is equivalent to the installation
        menu entry in the Install Digital Asset Library dialog.

    change_oplibraries_file:
        When `oplibraries_file` is not `None` and this parameter is `True`,
        Houdini will modify the OPlibraries file, adding the hda file to it.

    force_use_assets:
        When `True`, ensure that the definitions inside the hda file are
        current.  If they would not otherwise provide the current definition,
        they are marked as preferred to ensure they are current.  See
        [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#isPreferred] for more information.

    Note that, if you do not store the path to the hda file in an OPlibraries
    file, Houdini will store it in the current Houdini session.  So, when you
    load a hip file, it will try to load the hda files that it references.

::`uninstallFile(file_path, oplibraries_file=None, change_oplibraries_file=True)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::uninstallFile
    #replaces: Cmd:otunload
    Uninstall an hda file and all the node type definitions it provides from
    the current Houdini session.  The hda file and its contents on disk are
    unchanged.

    You can set `file_path` to the special name `"Embedded"` to refer to the
    digital assets embedded in the current hip file.  The following example
    removes any embedded digital asset definitions from the current Houdini
    session:
    {{{
    #!python
    hou.hda.uninstallFile("Embedded")
    }}}

    If `oplibraries_file` is not `None` and `change_oplibraries_file` is
    `True`, Houdini will remove the path to the hda from the specified
    OPlibraries file.  See [Hom:hou.hda#installFile] for more information
    about these parameters.

    If all the definitions of a node type are uninstalled, any instances
    of that node type will warn that they are using an incomplete asset
    definition.  They will, however, retain their parameter values as spare
    parameters.  Installing an hda file with the missing node type will
    restore those node instances and remove the warnings.

    See also [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#destroy].

::`reloadFile(file_path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::reloadFile
    #replaces: Cmd:otrefresh
    Reload the contents of an hda file, loading any updated digital asset
    definitions inside it.

    You only need to call this function if an hda file was modified from
    outside the current Houdini session.

::`reloadAllFiles(rescan=True)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::reloadAllFiles
    #replaces: Cmd:otrefresh
    Reload the digital asset files and update asset definitions 
    in the current session. 

    If the `rescan` is true, Houdini will check the hda directories for any new
    hda files and load them too.
    
    See also [Hom:hou.hda#reloadFile].

::`reloadNamespaceOrder()`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::reloadNamespaceOrder
    Check `HOUDINI_OPNAMESPACE_HIERARCHY` environment variable and 
    rebuild the node type preference order that determines the node type
    to use when only unqualified root name is used in scripts, or, when 
    Tab menu settings specify to show only a single preferred entry among
    several potential choices from different namespaces.

::`loadedFiles()` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::loadedFiles
    #replaces: Cmd:otrefresh, Cmd:otls
    Return a tuple of paths to the hda files that are loaded into the current
    Houdini session.

    This method is can be approximately implemented as follows:
    {{{
    #!python
    def loadedFiles():
        '''Return a list of hda files loaded into this Houdini session.'''
        # Look through all the node types, and for those that have digital
        # asset definitions, remember the hda file containing the definition.
        result = []
        for category in hou.nodeTypeCategories().values():
            for node_type in category.nodeTypes().values():
                definition = node_type.definition()
                if definition is None:
                    continue
                if definition.libraryFilePath() not in result:
                    result.append(definition.libraryFilePath())
        return result
    }}}

    See [Hom:hou.HDADefinition#isCurrent] for an example.

::`expandToDirectory(file_path, directory_path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::expandToDirectory
    #replaces: Cmd:otexpand
    Expand the contents of the hda file in `file_path` into the directory
    `directory_path`.  If the directory does not already exist it is created.

    When expanding an hda file, Houdini puts each digital asset definition in
    the file into its own directory.  As well, it puts each section inside a
    definition into its own file.  Each directory inside the expanded file tree
    contains a `Sections.List` file that maps the actual file or directory
    names into the section names, since section names may contain characters
    that cannot occur in directory or file names.  See [Hom:hou.HDASection] for
    more information about sections.

    This function provides an easy way to inspect and modify the contents of
    an hda file.  See also [Hom:hou.hda#collapseFromDirectory].

::`collapseFromDirectory(file_path, directory_path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::collapseFromDirectory
    #replaces: Cmd:otcollapse
    Given a directory that contains a previously expanded hda file, collapse
    it into the hda file specified by `file_path`.

    This function provides the inverse of [Hom:hou.hda#expandToDirectory].

::`renameSource(oplibraries_file, source_name=None)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::renameSource
    #replaces: Cmd:otrenamesource
    Give a name to an OPlibraries file.  This name appears in the __Operator
    Type Manager__'s list of OPlibraries file.  If `source_name` is `None`,
    the name is removed from the OPlibraries file.

    If the `oplibraries_file` does not already exist, it is created.

    See [Hom:hou.hda#installFile] for more information about OPlibraries files.

::`componentsFromFullNodeTypeName(node_type_name)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::componentsFromFullNodeTypeName
    Returns a tuple of operator type name components that constitute the 
    full node type name. The components in the tuple appear in the following 
    order:
    scope network type, node type namespace, node type core name, and version.


    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> # Parse the full name into components
    >>> hou.hda.componentsFromFullNodeTypeName('MyUserNamespace::MyHDA::2.5')
    ('', 'MyUserNamespace', 'MyHDA', '2.5')
    >>> hou.hda.componentsFromFullNodeTypeName('Sop/foreach::MyCounterHDA')
    ('Sop/foreach', '', 'MyCounterHDA', '')
    }}}

::`fullNodeTypeNameFromComponents(scope_node_type, name_space, name, version)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::fullNodeTypeNameFromComponents
    Returns a full node type name build out of the given components.
    The arguments represent the following components:
    scope network type, node type namespace, node type core name, and version.


    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> # Compose the node type full name from components
    >>> hou.hda.fullNodeTypeNameFromComponents('', 'userA', 'sphere', '')
    'userA::sphere'
    >>> hou.hda.fullNodeTypeNameFromComponents('', 'userB', 'myHda', '2.6')
    'userB::myHda::2.6'
    >>> hou.hda.fullNodeTypeNameFromComponents('Sop/foreach', '', 'MyCounterHDA', '')
    'Sop/foreach::MyCounterHDA'
    }}}

::`reloadHDAModule(self, hda_module)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::reloadHDAModule
    Reload the code in the PythonModule section corresponding to `hda_module`.
    `hda_module` must be an [Hom:hou.HDAModule] object.

    For example this code reloads and re-executes the code in the PythonModule
    section of the HDA definition for the 'foobar' node:
    {{{
    #!python
    hou.hda.reloadHDAModule(hou.node("/obj/foobar").hdaModule())
    }}}


::`safeguardHDAs()` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::safeguardHDAs
    Return True if the Safeguard Operator Definitions configuration option is
    turned on.  When safeguarding is turned on then no digital asset definition
    can be modified in the Houdini session.

::`setSafeguardHDAs(on)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::setSafeguardHDAs
    Set whether the Safeguar Operator Definitions configuration option should
    be turned on or off.  The `on` argument must be either True of False. 


== Callbacks ==

::`setStateEventCallback(hda_globals, state_name, event_name, callback)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::setStateEventCallback

    Register a Python callback that the given state will call whenever a
    particular event (or action) occurs on the node of a particular type.
    This static method will add a special dictionary to hda_globals.
    NOTE:
    This must be called from inside a Python Module section with
    `hda_globals = globals()`.

    {{{
    #!python
    def callback():
        print "in callback"
    hou.hda.setStateEventCallback(globals(), 'objmirror', 'mirror', callback)
    }}}

    This code will cause the Mirror shelf tool to invoke `callback` when the
    object which has the associated Python Module.

    State Callbacks:
        `objmirror`:
            `isWorldSpace()`:
                Returns a bool indicating whether the mirror occurs in world
                space.
            `mirror(kwargs)`:
                Performs mirroring on `kwargs['node']` using the scale vector
                `kwargs['scale']`.

::`addEventCallback(self, event_types, callback)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::addEventCallback
    
    Register a Python callback that Houdini will call whenever a particular
    action, or event, occurs with digital asset libraries.
    
    Callbacks only persist for the current session. For example, they are not saved to the `.hip` file. If you want persistent callbacks in every session, you can add them in code in `pythonrc.py` (runs on startup) or `456.py` (runs when the user opens a `.hip` file). See [where to add Python scripting|/hom/locations] for more information.

    `event_types`:
        A sequence of [Hom:hou.hdaEventType] enumeration values describing the event types that will cause Houdini to call the `callback` function.

    `callback`:
        A callable Python object, such as a function or bound method. Houdini will call this function whenever one of the event types in `event_types` occurs.
        
        Houdini calls the function with an `event_type` keyword argument containing the [Hom:hou.hdaEventType] value corresponding to the event that triggered the callback.
        
        Houdini will pass additional keyword arguments depending on the event type. For example, in a callback for the `LibraryInstalled` or `LibraryUninstalled` events, Houdini will pass a `library_path` keyword argument containing the path of the `.hda` file that was installed or uninstalled. See [Hom:hou.hdaEventType] for the additional arguments passed for each event type.
        
        You can add `**kwargs` to the argument list to accept all keyword arguments, to allow the same callback to be used for different events, or to be safe from future changes:
        
        {{{
        #!python
        def event_callback(event_type, **kwargs):
            ...
        }}}

    NOTE:
        If you try to add the exact same callback function more than once, Houdini will still only call the function only once in response to an event. However, it may be useful to "add" the same function if you want to register it with different `event_types`.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the `event_types` list argument is
    empty.

    The following example shows to set up a function that's called whenever a new asset is added to Houdini:

    {{{
    #!python
    
    def hda_event(event_type, asset_definition, **kwargs):
        label = asset_definition.description()
        library_path = asset_definition.libraryFilePath()
        print("New asset %s in %s" % (label, library_path))
    
    hou.hda.addEventCallback(hou.hdaEventType.AssetCreated, hda_event)
    }}}

    See also [Hom:hou.hda#removeEventCallback] and [Hom:hou.hda#removeAllEventCallbacks].

::`removeEventCallback(self, event_types, callback)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::removeEventCallback
    Given a callback that was previously added and a sequence
    of [Hom:hou.hdaEventType] enumerated values, remove those event types from
    the set of event types for the callback.  If the remaining set of event
    types is empty, the callback will be removed entirely.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the `event_types` list argument is
    empty.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the callback had not been previously
    added.

    See [Hom:hou.hda#addEventCallback] for more information.

::`removeAllEventCallbacks(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hda::removeAllEventCallbacks
    Remove all event callbacks for all event types.

    See [Hom:hou.hda#addEventCallback] for more information.

::`eventCallbacks()` -> `tuple` of (`tuple` of [Hom:hou.hdaEventType], callback):
    #cppname: HOM_ui::eventCallbacks
    Return a tuple of all the Python callbacks that have been registered with
    calls to [Hom:hou.hda#addEventCallback].
