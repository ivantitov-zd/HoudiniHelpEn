@parameters

== Parameters ==

Compute Range:
    #id: computerange
    
    Click to fill in the __Min height__ and __Max height__ parameters with the current minimum and maximum height of the input.
    
Min Height:
    #id: minheight
    
    Don't modify areas below this elevation (in meters).
    
Max Height:
    #id: maxheight
    
    Don't modify areas above this elevation (in meters).
    
Terrace Offset:
    #id: terraceoffset
    
    Adds a vertical offset to the terrace levels, to let you move the levels up or down.
    
Terrace Step Size:
    #id: terracestepsize
    
    The height of each level, in meters. Higher values give a smaller number of tall levels. Lower values a greater number of shorter levels.
    
Slope Mask Smoothing:
    #id: slopesmoothradius
    
    Blur radius for the generated mask layers representing the "clipped" areas (`mesa`) and the clipped edges (`cliffs`).
    
Mesa Max Slope:
    #id: mesa_maxslope
    
    Smooths the generated mask layer representing the clipped areas (`mesa`). 
    
Cliff Min Slope:
    #id: cliff_minslope
    
    Smooths the generated mask layer representing the edges of the clipped areas (`cliffs`).
    
Smooth Edges:
    #id: smoothedges
    
    Smoothness of the transition between terrace steps. Higher values give a gentler slope between levels. Lower values give a sharper vertical drop between levels.
