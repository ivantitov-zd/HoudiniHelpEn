Creates a particle fluid object with the necessary data and parameters
to work with a [FLIP solver|Node:dop/flipsolver].

See [particle fluid simulations|/fluid/] for more information about
FLIP fluid simulations.

Increasing the __Particle Separation__ will lower the resolution, which will make your simulation faster to process.

Grid Scale:
    A scaling factor used to calculate the division size of the
    advection grid from the particle separation. The default
    should be good for most applications.

Collision separation:

    Narrow Band:
        Use this option to generate a __Narrow Band__ FLIP simulation.
        This consists of a thin band of fluid particles near the fluid surface and
        volumes to represent the internals of the fluid (e.g. surface and velocity).
        
        The __SOP Path__ generates particles from the specified geometry
        (similar to __Particle Field__). The __Surface Volume__ and
        __Velocity Volume__ paths specify the SOPs to extract for the
        associated fluid volumes.

== Guides ==

The parameters on the __Visualization__ sub-tab let you turn various
visualizations on or off quickly.

The parameters on the __Particles__ sub-tab control the visualization 
of the fluid particles. These parameters are explained in the
[help for the Guides tab of the Particle Fluid Object DOP|particlefluidobject#guides].

The other sub-tabs let you visualize various fields or attributes
in the object. The help for the [Scalar Field
Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] or [Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] provides more
details about how these work.
