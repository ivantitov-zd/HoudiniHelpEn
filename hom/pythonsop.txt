= Define a geometry node (SOP) using Python =

== Overview ==

* If you want to define a new, reusable geometry node using Python, see "creating a new node type" below.

* If you just want to script a one-off change, you can use the [Python SOP|Node:sop/python] to run a Python snippet on geometry without having to create a new node type.

== Creating a new node type == (node_type)

# Choose __File > New operator type__.

# Set the __Operator style__ to `python`, then set __Network type__ to __Geometry operator__.

# Use the __Save to library__ option to set an OTL library file to save the new node type into.

# Click __Accept__.

    The [type properties window|/ref/windows/optype] appears.
    
# Use the [options in the type properties window|/ref/windows/optype] to define the interface for your new node type.

# Click the __Code__ tab to view and edit the Python script that defines the SOP's behavior.

TIP:
    If you need to edit the script after closing the type properties window, right-click an instance of the node and choose __Type properties__.

== Writing the code ==

To get the node's incoming geometry, use

{{{
#!python
geo = hou.pwd().geometry()
}}}

The `hou.pwd()` function returns the currently cooking [Node|Hom:hou.Node], and the `geometry()` method returns a [Hom:hou.Geometry] object.  If an input SOP
is connected to the first input of the Python SOP, Houdini copies the input
SOP's geometry into the Python SOP's geometry before running the Python code.

TIP:
    To get the geometry from an input other than the first, use the `inputs()` method of [Node|Hom:hou.Node] to get the input nodes, and then the `geometry()` method of one of those nodes to get its geometry.
    
    {{{
    #!python
    this_node = hou.pwd()
    inputs = this_node.inputs()

    # Get the geometry from the second input
    # (first input=0, second input=1, third=2, etc.)
    second_input_geo = inputs[1].geometry()
    }}}

You can then call methods on the geometry object (`geo` in this example) to modify the outgoing geometry. See the documentation for the [Hom:hou.Geometry] object for how to manipulate the geometry.

For example, to add a polygon to the geometry:

{{{
#!python
poly = geo.createPolygon()
for position in (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0):
    point = geo.createPoint()
    point.setPosition(position)
    poly.addVertex(point)
}}}

If you want to create a "source" node rather than a "filter" node, simply set the node's number of inputs to 0 in the type properties. Calling `hou.pwd().geometry()` will return an empty geometry you can add to.

== Making the SOP interruptible == (making_interruptable)

If the node takes a long time to cook when given large input
geometry, you may want to be able to interrupt its cooking by pressing Escape.
To make your SOP interruptible, periodically call
[Hom:hou.updateProgressAndCheckForInterrupt].  For example, you can press
Escape to stop this SOP from cooking further:

{{{
#!python
geo = hou.pwd().geometry()

# Evaluate the "t" parameter to see how much to translate each point.
translation = hou.Vector3(hou.parmTuple("t").eval())

for point in geo.points():
    # Set the new position for each point.
    point.setPosition(point.position() + translation)

    # Check if the user pressed Escape.
    if hou.updateProgressAndCheckForInterrupt():
	break
}}}

== SOP Errors and Warnings == (errors_and_warnings)

If your Python surface node generates an exception, the node will turn red
with an error and you can view the stack trace of the error by middle-clicking
on it.

If you would like to generate an error message to the user that doesn't contain
a Python stack trace, raise a [Hom:hou.NodeError] exception.  For example,
running

{{{
#!python
raise hou.NodeError("Invalid parameter settings")
}}}

will turn the node red with an error message of `"Invalid parameter settings"`.
Similarly, you can add node warnings by raising instances of
[Hom:hou.NodeWarning].

== Creating local variables for new attributes == (local_variables)

[Hom:hou.Geometry#addAttrib] contains a parameter to control whether Houdini
creates a local variable for newly added attributes.  There is no need to
modify the varmap attribute directly.

== Profiling the SOP code == (profiling)

You can profile your Python surface node with Python's `cProfile` module.

TIP:
    If you are on Ubuntu, use `aptitude` to install `python-profiler` since the standard library is missing pstats in Ubuntu.
    
You should write your surface node's script so the work is done inside a function, instead of a bunch of statements at the top level, for example:

{{{
#!python
def cook():
    poly = geo.createPolygon()
    for position in (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0):
        point = geo.createPoint()
        point.setPosition(position)
        poly.addVertex(point)
        
cook()
}}}

Import `cProfile` and use `cProfile.runctx` to call your function instead of calling it directly:

{{{
#!python
def cook():
    poly = geo.createPolygon()
    for position in (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0):
        point = geo.createPoint()
        point.setPosition(position)
        poly.addVertex(point)
        
cProfile.runctx('cook()', globals(), locals())
}}}

This will print a summary of your script's run time to the Python shell when the node cooks.

== Writing Part of the SOP in C++ ==

See [Extending HOM with C++|extendingwithcpp] to see how to easily write a
portion of your SOP in C++.

== Storing your Code Outside a Digital Asset == (external_source)

You may want to store your source code outside of your digital asset in
order to manage it under a version control system.  It is possible to use
the Type Properties dialog to set up your asset's parameters and then inject
the Python source code into the `otl` file.

You can use the following function to update your digital asset to use the
Python source code from a file:
{{{
#!python
def loadPythonSourceIntoAsset(otl_file_path, node_type_name, source_file_path):
    # Load the Python source code.
    source_file = open(source_file_path, "rb")
    source = source_file.read()
    source_file.close()

    # Find the asset definition in the otl file.
    definitions = [definition
	for definition in hou.hda.definitionsInFile(otl_file_path)
	if definition.nodeTypeName() == node_type_name]
    assert(len(definitions) == 1)
    definition = definitions[0]

    # Store the source code into the PythonCook section of the asset.
    definition.addSection("PythonCook", source)
}}}

      filters.
