== Morph between geometry shapes ==

The [Morph tool|/shelf/morph] on the __Deform__ shelf lets you edit
geometry at the object level, and automatically creates the necessary
Edit and Blend Shapes nodes at the geometry level.

:task:Blend between shapes:
    # Model the "normal" shape of the surface(s). Then use the [Edit
      operator|Node:sop/edit] and/or other surface operations (such
      as a  [lattice deformer|Node:sop/lattice] ) to deform the
      surface.

      You _do not need to model the normal and deformed versions as
      separate surfaces_. Because of the procedural nature of
      Houdini, you can simply blend between the surface at two
      different points in its construction history.

      You can blend between any number of shapes (not just 2).

    # At the geometry level, use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]
      to create a [Blend Shapes node|Node:sop/blendshapes].

    # Connect the various shapes you want to blend between to the
      input of the Blend Shapes node.

    # Use the __Weight__ parameters to control the blending of the
      shapes. See below for how to make blending between two inputs
      easier.

:task:Use the Morph tool to set up blend shapes at the object level:

    #  [Select the points|/basics/select]  you want to morph, then click the [Morph tool|/shelf/morph] on the __Deform__ shelf tab.

    # The Morph tool essentially works like the [Edit
      operator|Node:sop/edit] from the geometry (SOP) level. Use the
      [transform handles|/basics/handles#basic-handles]  to edit the selected
      points in the viewport.

    # The Morph tool automatically creates an [Edit node|Node:sop/edit] and a [Blend Shapes node|Node:sop/blendshapes] at the geometry (SOP) level for the geometry you edit.

      Use the __Weight__ parameters to control the blending of the
      shapes. See below for how to make blending between two inputs
      easier.

:task:Make blending between two inputs easier:
    * The Blend Shapes node has separate __Weight__ sliders for each
      input, letting you mix them arbitrarily. In a two-shape
      scenario however, you probably only want one slider control
      that blends between the two inputs. To do that, you need to
      link the second slider to the first slider so it automatically
      goes down/up as the other goes up/down.

      Press ((RMB)) on the first slider's value and choose __Copy
      Parameter__. Then press ((RMB)) on the second slider's value
      and choose __Paste Relative Reference__. Houdini inserts a
      parameter reference expression to the first slider. Finally,
      to make the second slider invert the value of the first
      slider, insert `1-` in front of the expression.

:task:Use a bone angle to control deformation:
    # You can use drive the amount of blending between the normal
      (rest) geometry and the deformed geometry using the angle
      between two bones of a character. This lets you do things like
      make a muscle bulge as the character moves its arm.

      Set up a Blend Shapes node and link the __Weight__ parameters
      using the steps above.

    # In the Blend Shapes node, click in the first __Weight__
      parameter's text field to edit it.

    # You can use the [boneangle|Exp:boneangle] expression function
      to get the angle between two bones.

      The `boneangle` function's result is an angle in degrees (e.g.
      `90` or `120`). The Blend Shapes' __Weight__ parameter, on the
      other hand, is from `0` to `1`. Use the [smooth|Exp:smooth]
      expression function to map the minimum and maximum bone angles
      to 0 and 1.

      Finally, depending on how you connected the Blend Shapes node,
      you may need to invert the result of the `smooth` function by
      inserting `1-` before it. Do this if the deform is backwards,
      for example the muscle bulges when the arm is extended instead
      of when it's flexed.

      Here's an example of a finished function. Your function will
      probably have different values for the bone names and the
      minimum and maximum bone angles.

== Wire deform ==

Character deformations, especially in the face, often must work with the
contours of the deforming surface. Wire deformers make it possible to
capture and deform the surface along these contours. You can then deform
along the U direction of the curve or animate the shape of the curve to
achieve more complex deformations.

=== How to use a curve to drive deformation ===

steps>>
    # [Go to the geometry level|/ref/panes/network] containing the surfaces you
      want to deform.

    # [Draw a curve|/shelf/curve]. You can [snap the curve to the
      surface|/model/aids] you want to deform.

      [Image:/images/eyebrow_curve.jpg]

    # In the  [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] , change the
      curve's __Primitive type__ to NURBS.

    # In the viewer, use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the
      [Group operator|Node:sop/group].

    # Select the curve, then click ((RMB)) to finish the selection.

    # In the parameter editor, change the __Group name__ to a meaningful
      name for the deformer. In the  [network
      editor|/ref/panes/network] , rename the group
      operator with a meaningful name.

    # In the network editor, use the tab menu to choose the [Wire
      Capture operator|Node:sop/wirecapture].

    #  [Connect|/ref/panes/network]  the geometry you want to deform to the
      wire capture node's first input. Connect the curve's group node to
      the wire capture node's second input.

      If you want to put several wire deformers on the same piece of
      geometry, create a [Merge node|Node:sop/merge], connect the curve
      group nodes to the merge node's inputs, then connect the merge
      node to the wire capture node's second input.

    # In the parameter editor, click the __Capture__ tab, then click
      __Initialize From groups__. This uses the group (or groups)
      connected to the second input.

    # Set the __U radius__ and __V radius__ parameters for the curves.
      These options control the distance within which the curves will
      influence the geometry.

      [Image:/images/wire_capture.jpg]

    # In the network editor, right-click the wire capture node's output
      and choose the [Wire Deform operator|Node:sop/wiredeform].

    # Connect the group (or merge) node's output to both the second and
      third inputs of the wire deform node. These inputs control the
      rest geometry and the deformed geometry.

    # Turn on the wire deform node's  [display flag|/nodes/sop/] . In the
      parameter editor, click the __Deform__ tab, then click
      __Initialize from Rest Groups__.

    # Use the __U deform__ parameter to control how much the curve(s)
      deform the geometry.

    # To animate the deformer, you can keyframe the __U Deform__
      parameter, and/or animate the shape of the
      deformer.

You may want to create  [HUD sliders|/basics/handles]  for the U deform
parameter or the blend parameter.

A real face rig will have many wire deformers representing the
muscles that control facial expressions. You can promote the various
parameters used to control the deformations along the curve, and any
blends, up to the character's digital asset interface for high level
access by animators.

=== How to vary the capture radius along a wire deformer ===

steps>>
    # In the  [network editor|/ref/panes/network] , select the
      wire capture node.

    # In the Parameter pane, Alt-click the right text box of the __U
      Radius and lookup__ parameter to set a keyframe. The channel on
      this parameter represents scaling of the radius along the length
      of the curve.

    # Press ((RMB)) on the text field and choose __Scope Channels__.

    # In the animation editor, Alt-click somewhere to the right of the
      existing keyframe to add a second key, then Alt-click again in the
      center of the channel.

    # Drag the keys up and down to vary the radii of the wire deformer
      along its length.

      [Image:/images/lookup_channel.jpg]

      In the Perspective view, you should see the radius along the
      eyebrow wire adjusting to match the shape of the channel.

      [Image:/images/eyebrow_vary.jpg]

The channel defines a lookup table that controls the U radius along the
curve. The values for the first and last key on the channel control the
start and end of the wire with any internal keys being adjusted along
the curve proportional to their position in time.
