"""Sets the channel scope."""

:usage: `chscope [-w] [-a] [-A | -C] [-k] [-l] [-c | -e] <<channel_patterns>>`
:usage: `chscope [-a] [-f]`
:usage: `chscope [-z]`

The chscope command will set or modify the channel scope according to
the patterns specified.

Patterns may be prefixed by a '+' or ',' character to add channels to
the current scope or by a '-' to remove channels from the scope. No
prefix or an '=' character will set the scope to the given pattern.

NOTE:
    The results will not be visible if the animation editor is not currently open. Use the `-w` option to open a animation editor if it is closed.

NOTE:
    Unlike `+'` and `=`, the `-` character is allowed in node names. It is only treated as a special scope prefix at the start of a pattern or when immediately preceded by whitespace.

@options
    `-w`:
        Open a animation editor if needed.
    `-c`:
        (Collapse) Scope all channel group paths into the dopesheet as
        a single row.
    `-e`:
        (Expand) Scope and expand all channel group paths into the
        dopesheet as separate rows.
    `-a`:
        Allow scoping of parameters that don't yet have live channels.
    `-f`:
        Show flag states for each parameter.
    `-z`:
        Clear the channel scope.
    `-A`:
        Exclude animated channels.
    `-C`:
        Exclude constant channels.
    `-k`:
        Include only channels with non-integer keyframes.
    `-l`:
        Scope animation layers related to the scoped channels.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chscope tx+ry+sz
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chscope tx,ry,sz
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chscope tx ry sz
    }}}
    The above three are all equivalent.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    chscope geo1/* -geo1/r?
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chscope +light1/t?
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chscope -light1/ty
    }}}
