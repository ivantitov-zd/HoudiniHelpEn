"""Delays the input, and can be run in normal or time-sliced mode."""

This CHOP delays the input, and can be run in normal or time-sliced
mode. Like an echo, it delays the input and applies a gain (multiplier).
The input may be copied up to four times, each copy with its own delay
and gain. The copies are layered onto the output track by adding them
together. The Delay CHOP can be used to create echoes, with a bit more
control over the delay time and gain than the Parametric EQ CHOP.

It also has the __Remainder__ option of the Copy CHOP when in normal mode,
which determines with extending the out put of the CHOP or not.

This CHOP may be time-sliced by enabling the __Time Slice__ flag in the
Common page.


@parameters

== Delay ==

    Number Of Copies:
        #channels: /numcopies

        The number of times the input channel is copied. Each copy has
        its own delay and gain, and the output channel is the sum of
        these copies.
    Remainder:
        What to do with samples that are delayed beyond the end of the
        input clip's interval.

        Discard Remainder:
            Keep the output clip the same length as the input.
        Make Output Longer:
            Extend the output channels to fit all delayed samples.
        Mix Remainder to Beginning:
            Add the remaining samples to the samples at the start of the
            channel.
    Delay 1-4:
        #channels: /delay1-4

        The delay of each copy. This is expressed in Units, as set on
        the Common page.
    Gain 1-4:
        #channels: /gain1-4

        The gain, or scale, of each copy.
