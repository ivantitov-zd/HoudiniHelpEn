"""Enable/disable user options in a particular viewport."""

:usage: `viewoptenable <<viewport>> <<apply_to>> [ [+|-]<<option_pattern>> ...]`

See [how to refer to viewers and viewports|/commands/_guide#viewers] .

The <<apply_to>> argument specifies which geometry these settings should
apply to. This can be one of:

all:
    Apply to both selected and unselected (H11 Scene Renderer)
sel:
    Apply to selected (H11 Scene Renderer)
unsel:
    Apply to unselected (H11 Scene Renderer)
templ:
    Apply to templates (H11 Scene Renderer)
target:
    Apply to target output (ie. the display sop when in "view current"
    mode) (H11 Scene Renderer)

or:

displayset\:scene:
    Unselected geometry at the scene (object) level.
displayset\:selectscene:
    Selected geometry at the scene (object) level.
displayset\:ghostscene:
    External object geometry when not at the scene (object) level and
    external objects are being ghosted.
displayset\:display:
    Geometry for the node with the display flag set in the currently modeled
    object.
displayset\:current:
    Geometry for the selected node in the currently modeled object if it is
    not also the display node.
displayset\:template:
    Geometry for all the nodes with the template flag set in the currently
    modeled object.

With no settings, the command prints the command that would enable the
current set of active display options for the specified viewport.
