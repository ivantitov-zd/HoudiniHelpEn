"""Creates a Hybrid Object from SOP Geometry."""

== Overview ==

This object simulates both tetrahedrons and polygons in a single object. The polygons may share points with the tetrahedra. For example a tetrahedral mesh may have a skin envelope consisting of polygons. These polygons are simulated similar to a thin layer of solid material. The material properties of the polygons may be controlled separately from the material properties of the tetrahedra to create interesting effects (e.g., skin wrinkling) that are not easy to come by using tetrahedrons alone.


== How to ==

:task: Create a soft hybrid object:
    # Append a [Solid Conform node|Node:sop/solidconform] to your geometry.

    # In the Solid Conform node's parameters, turn on __Add surface triangles__ to make sure the polygonal skin is composed of triangles.

    # On the __Solid__ tab, click the [Icon:DOP/hybridobject] Hybrid Object tool.

    # Select the geometry to convert to an hybrid object and press ((Enter)).
    
        This tool creates a [Hybrid Object node|Node:dop/hybridobject] in the current simulation and sets it up to import from the selected object.

:task: Create a wrinkly hybrid object:
    # Append a [Solid Conform node|Node:sop/solidconform] to your geometry.

    # In the Solid Conform node's parameters, turn on __Add surface triangles__ to make sure the polygonal skin is composed of triangles.

    # On the __Solid__ tab, click the [Icon:SHELF/organic_tissue] Organic Tissue tool.

    # Select the geometry to convert to an hybrid object and press ((Enter)).

        This tool creates a [Hybrid Object node|Node:dop/hybridobject] in the current simulation and sets it up to import from the selected object. It sets the physical properties of the new object to simulate the look of soft material contained inside a skin that can wrinkle and bunch.

NOTE:
    Once you convert geometry to a solid object, you can only transform, rotate, and scale it at the first frame.
