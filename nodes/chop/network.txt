"""Similar to the Pipe In/Out CHOPs in Network mode."""

This CHOP is similar to the Pipe In/Out CHOPs in Network mode. It
provides a fast, asynchronous connection between two remote Houdini
processes. The CHOP operates in either Transmit or Receive mode.

A connection is establish between a client Network CHOP and a server
Network CHOP. By default, the Transmitting Network CHOP is the server;
however, if the parameter "Default Client/Server Setup" is off, the
Receiving Network CHOP becomes the server. Both the Transmitting and
Receiving CHOPs must choose the same client/server setup. This option is
mainly for interfacing with external applications; if you are
transmitting from Houdini to Houdini, you do not need to change this
parameter.

The server Network CHOP (normally the Transmitter) selects a port number
between 5000 and 10000. The client Network CHOP (the receiver) then
connects to the server by setting the address to the server hostname,
and the port to the same port as the server Network CHOP.

The Transmitting Network CHOP requires an input to transmit.
Transmission occurs whenever the input changes, or if in Current Frame
or Time Slice mode, whenever the playbar moves. The Network CHOP can
choose a Data Link mode to send the current frame only (for low
bandwidth situations), the current time slice (for realtime
applications) or the full channel. Both the Transmitting and Receiving
CHOPs should use the same "Data Link" mode.

The Receiving Network CHOP receives all of the data from the
Transmitter. However, if the CHOP is not actively reading the data (by
cooking) it will pile up in the buffer. By default, the maximum buffer
size is 1000 samples per channel (the limit can be disabled).


@parameters

== Network ==

    Direction:
        Transmit or Receive data. When transmitting, an input is
        required.
    Default Client/Server Setup:
        When on, the Transmitting CHOP is the server; when off, it is
        the client (see above).
    Address:
        The address of the remote server.
    Port:
        The port to use (between 5000 and 10000). You can have multiple
        parallel connections as long as the port numbers are distinct. A
        transmitter/receiver pair must use the same port.
    Data Link:
        The portion of data to send over the link.

        Current Frame Only:
            Sends the value of the current frame (1 sample per
            channel).
        Current Time Slice:
            Sends the portion of the channel from the last cook time to
            the current cook time.
        Full Channel:
            Sends all the data in all the channels.
    Endian:
        Transmit either Little Endian format data (Intel) or Big Endian
        (MIPs, PowerPC).
    Active:
        Data is only transmitted or received when this toggle is on.
     
== Channel ==
    
    Send Channel Names:
        Sends the channel names as well as the data if on.
    Receive Most Recent Data:
        Uses the most recently sent data. If the buffer contains 10
        samples and 4 are required, the most recent 4 are used and the
        previous 6 are lost.
    Limit Input Buffer Size:
        Places a limitation on the size of the receive buffer (defined
        by the next parameter).
    Buffer Size:
        The maximum number of samples that the receive buffer can hold
        (per channel).
