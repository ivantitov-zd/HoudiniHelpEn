"""Imports a 2D image map from a file or compositing node into a height field or mask."""

[Image:/images/nodes/sop/heightfield_file.png]

TIP:
    To write a heightfield and/or mask to an image file, use [HeightField Output|Node:sop/heightfield_output].


@parameters

Use COP:
    #id: usecoppath
    
    Use the output of a compositing network instead of a file.
    
COP Network:
    #id: coppath
    
    The path to the compositing network to use to generate the image data, when __Use COP__ is on.
    
File: 
    #id: filename
    
    The path to the image file to import.
    
Reload File:
    #id: reload
    
    Click to reload the image data from the disk file.
    
Channel:
    #id: monoop
    
    Selects which data channel to use as the value for the height field/mask.
    
Type:
    #id: type
    
    Whether to import the image data into a `height` layer or `mask` layer. For consistency with the [Heightfield|Node:sop/heightfield] node, this node creates both layers but leaves the other layer set to 0.

Animated:
    If not enabled, the file or compositing network will always be evaluated on frame 1.  If enabled, the specified frame is used.  By disabling animation
    time dependency is avoided.


== Size ==

Size Method:
    #id: sizemethod
    
    How to choose the size of the new volumes.
    
    Size of Largest Axis:
        Make the longest side of the image the size specified in the __Size__ parameter, and set the size of the other side proportionally.
    
    Grid Spacing:
        Create a voxel for each pixel in the image, with spacing controlled by the __Grid spacing__ parameter.
    
Size:
    #id: size
    
    The size in meters of the longest side of the image, when __Size method__ is "size of largest axis".
    
Grid Spacing:
    #id: gridspacing
    
    Distance between grid points, when __Size method__ is "grid spacing".
    
Uniform Scale:
    #id: uniformscale
    #contentfrom: heightfield#scale


== Height ==

Height Scale:
    #id: heightscale
    
    Scales the height values from the image.
    
Clamp Minimum:
    #id: clampmin
    
    Turn on the checkbox to clamp values to be at least this value.
    
Clamp Maximum: Clamp max at this value.
    #id: clampmax
    
    Turn on the checkbox to clamp values to be at most this value.
    
    
== Position ==

[Include:heightfield#orient]
        
[Include:heightfield#t]
    
Rotate:
    #id: rotate
    
    When importing a mask, rotates the image data in the grid space. When importing a height field, rotates the volumes in world space.
