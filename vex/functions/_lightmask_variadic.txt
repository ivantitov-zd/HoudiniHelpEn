#type: include

== Light inclusion/exclusion options ==

:varg:categories:
    #type: string
    #default: "*"
    
    Specifies lights to include/exclude by their "category" tags.
    This is the preferred include/exclude lights rather than pattern matching
    light names with the `"lightmask"` keyword argument.
    
    For example:
    
    {{{
    #!vex
    diff = diffuse(nml, "lightmask", "hero | fill");
    }}}
    
    See [light categories|/render/lights#categories] for more information.

:varg:lightmask:
    #type: string
    #default: "*"
    
    When evaluating light and shadow shaders, objects have pre-defined light
    masks. This mask is usually specified in the geometry object and
    specifies a list of lights which are used to illuminate a surface or fog
    shader. It is possible to override the default light mask by specifying
    a "lightmask" argument.

    For example:

    {{{
    #!vex
    diff = diffuse(nml, "lightmask", "light*,^light2");
    }}}

    ...will cause all lights whose names begin with "light" except for a
    light named "light2" to be considered for diffuse illumination.

    All Houdini scoping patterns, excepting group expansion, are supported:

    * `*` - wild-card match

    * `?` - single character match

    * `^` - exclusion operator

    * `[list]` - character list match
