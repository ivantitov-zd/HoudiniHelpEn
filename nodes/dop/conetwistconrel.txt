= Cone Twist Constraint Relationship =

The Cone Twist Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint
relationship data types. These constraint relationships are attached as
subdata to a [Constraint DOP|Node:dop/constraint] node to control the
relationship between the Anchor nodes attached to the Constraint.

A Cone Twist Constraint Relationship is similar to a [Hard Constraint
Relationship|Node:dop/hardconrel], but specifies an elliptical cone
within which rotation may take place. The cone is described by
specifying a maximum rotation on each axis.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters
    == Data Options ==

    Max Up Rotation:
        The maximum rotation up or down in degrees.
    Max Out Rotation:
        The maximum rotation from side to side in degrees.
    Max Twist:
        The maximum twist in degrees.
    Softness:
        Once an angle is greater than softness * the maximum
        angle, the constraint begins to take effect. Lowering
        the value of softness softens the constraint boundaries.
    Allow Initial Violation of Limits:
        #id: computeinitialerror
        If the rotation limits are initially violated, the limits will not be enforced but further rotation will be prevented.
        This allows the objects to naturally move back within the rotation limits, instead of introducing sudden motion at the beginning of the simulation.
    Constraint Force Mixing:
        Increase this to make the constraint spongier, and potentially increase the stability of the simulation.
        The angular component of the constraint may be violated by an amount proportional to the force required to re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
    Bias Factor:
        The rate at which the constraint corrects errors in orientation.
        A value of 1 will ensure that the constraint is always obeyed.
        It is recommended to keep bias between 0.2 and 0.5.
    Relaxation Factor:
        The rate at which the angular velocity is changed by the
        constraint. A low value means the constraint will modify
        the velocities slowly, leaving the boundaries appearing
        softer.
    Position CFM:
        #id: positioncfm
        Increase this to make the constraint spongier, and potentially increase the stability of the simulation.
        The position component of the constraint may be violated by an amount proportional to the force required to re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
    Position ERP:
        #id: positionerp
        Specifies what proportion of the position error will be fixed during the next simulation step.
        A value between 0.1 and 0.8 is recommended for most simulation.
    Goal Twist Axis:
        The goal direction of the cone.  Defaults to the X axis.
    Goal Up Axis:
        The goal direction of the up axis. Defaults to the Y axis.
        This should be perpendicular to the twist axis. The out
        axis is calculated as the cross product of the twist
        and up axes.
    Constrained Twist Axis:
        The initial twist axis of the constrained object.
    Constrained Up Axis:
        The initial up axis of the constrained object. This should be
        perpendicular to the constrained twist axis.

    Enable Motor:
        #id: motor_enabled
        If enabled, the constraint will attempt to also guide the constrained object to a target orientation within the rotation limits.

    Target Current Pose:
        #id: motor_targetcurrentpose
        The __Motor Target__ will be set to the current orientation.
        This can be used to add stiffness to the constrained object and resist changes to its relative orientation.

    Motor Target:
        #id: motor_targetr
        Specifies the target orientation (relative to the goal anchor) that the motor should attempt to achieve.

    Use Initial Motor Target:
        #id: motor_hastargetprev
        Optionally specifies the motor target at the beginning of the timestep.
        The solver will interpolate the motor target at each substep for more accurate behavior when the motor target is animated.

    Initial Motor Target:
        #id: motor_targetprevr
        Specifies the motor target at the beginning of the timestep.

    Ignore Mass:
        #id: motor_normalizemaximpulse
        Factors out the mass of the objects when setting the __Max Impulse__ for the constraint.
        This makes it simpler to set up motors with a similar strength for different pairs of objects.

    Max Impulse:
        #id: motor_maximpulse
        Specifies the maximum impulse that the constraint solver can apply to achieve the __Motor Target__.
        Larger values will cause the motor to be stronger.

    Motor Correction Time:
        #id: motor_erp
        Specifies how gradually the constraint attempts to correct deviations from the __Motor Target__.

    Motor CFM:
        #id: motor_cfm
        Increasing this value makes the motor component of the constraint softer.
        A small positive value can increase the stability of the simulation.
