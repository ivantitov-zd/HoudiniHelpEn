"""Creates fur geometry for rendering with a Mantra Fur Procedural."""

== Overview ==

The Fur object creates fur rooted on the specified skin geometry.

NOTE:
    You need UV coordinates when using any of the texture map parameters. See [UV Texture|Node:sop/texture].

    #id: 116797623

== Tips ==

- Memory usage can be reduced by transferring values as primitive attributes from the skin instead of point/vertex attributes from the guides.

- The __Radius__ parameter on the __Guide__ tab affects how big of an area is influenced by each guide hair. You can also create a primitive attribute called for more control. If this value is too small, some hairs might not have any guide hairs influencing them. If the value is too big, the effect of individual guide hairs will be difficult to see.

- The `guides` subnet inside the [Fur Object|Node:obj/fur] creates the initial guide hair curves.  This network can be replaced with one defining hand-modeled guides.  There are a few items to keep in mind when creating this network:

    - The guides are used as the rest pose of the wires and needs to be deformed to match animation on the skin.
    - The guides should have a primitive attribute called `guideorigin` indicating where the guide attaches to the skin in its rest position.
    - If you are adding dynamics, a point attribute called `pintoanimation` should be used to constrain the root point of each curve.

@parameters

== Basic ==

Display:
    #id: displayfur
    Whether or not this object is displayed. Turn on the checkbox to
    have Houdini use this parameter, then set the value to 0 to hide
    the object, or 1 to show the object. If the checkbox is off,
    Houdini ignores the value.

Type:
    #id: type
    Type of geometry to create.

    Polygon:
        Create a polyline.
    NURBS:
        Create a NURBS curve.
    Subdivision Curves:
        Create a polygon curve. This is much faster than NURBS.

Length:
    #id: length
    Specifies the length of the generated curves.

Segments:
    #id: segs
    Number of segments in each generated curve (ignored if geometry is
    provided by the __Guides__ input)

Distribution Seed:
    #id: seed
    Seed value for the random number generator

Display Density:
    #id: displaydensity
    The number of displayed curves is a result of the density
    multiplied by the area of the skin polygons.  The value of this
    parameter acts as a scalar multiplier to the optional `furdensity`
    attribute to determine the curve density.

Display Ratio:
    #id: displayratio
    Specifies a fraction of the curves to display.

Render Density:
    #id: renderdensity
    The number of rendered curves is a result of the density
    multiplied by the area of the skin polygons.  The value of this
    parameter acts as a scalar multiplier to the optional `furdensity`
    attribute to determine the curve density.

Render Ratio:
    #id: renderratio
    Specifies a fraction of the hairs to render.

Material:
    #id: material
    Path to the Material node.
    
Shade Fur in Viewport:
    It enables shaded open curve rendering in the viewport, which draws the hair curves as ribbons (instead of lines) and uses a hair-based lighting model for shading those curves.

== Guides ==

Use Guides:
    #id: useguides
    When enabled, the shape of rendered hairs will be interpolated from the
    guide hairs.

Display:
    #id: displayguides

    Color used to draw guide hairs.

Guide Type:
    Place At Every Surface Point:
        Creates a guide at every point of the skin.
    Scatter On Surface:
        Indicates guide hairs should be scattered across the skin instead of
        placed at points within the skin geometry.
    Use External:
        Fetches guides from an external geometry. In this mode, additional parameters will be displayed below, which can be useful for fixing common errors in imported guide curves.

    NOTE:
        These guides are expected to be static, so this is not the way to bring in simulated guides. To do this, please use the [Add Dynamics|/shelf/furdynamics] shelf tool, or manually add dynamics in `./guide_dynamics` within the Fur object.
    Draw Guides Manually:
        Doesn't generate any guides, instead allowing the user to create them from scratch, for example using tools on the [Grooming Shelf|/shelf/guidebrushes/].

Geometry:
    #id: guidegeo
    Path to an object containing guide geometry.

Resample To Match Fur Segments:
    Resamples external guides to match the __Segments__ parameter.

Reverse Curves:
    When importing external guides, reverses the order of vertices within each each curve. This should be used when the root vertex is not the first vertex in the curve. 

Snap To Skin:
    Moves external guides so the root sits exactly on the skin.

Distribution Seed:
    #id: guideseed
    The seed value for the random number generator.

Density:
    #id: guidedensity
    The number of guide hairs is a result of the density multiplied by the area

Higher frequency values result in more oscillations. The effect of this tool is easier to see when the number of segments per hair is increased.  

    TIP:
        Use the [Paint Frizz Frequency|/shelf/paintfurfrizzfrequency] tool if you want to change the number of noise oscillations along the length of hairs and use the [Paint Frizz Roughness|/shelf/paintfurfrizzroughness] if you want to change how smooth or rough each oscillation appears.

=== Transfer Groom To New Skin ===

:vimeo:Hair transfer
    #title: 116797623

Method:
    The method to use for updating to a new skin. Use the __Update From SOP__ button below to initiate the update.

    NOTE:
        The Recache Strokes method below does not leave any record of the original skin, and it'll appear like the groom was started on the current skin.

    Recache Strokes (Changed Topology, Small Position Changes):
        Performs the update by re-applying all recorded grooming strokes to guides generated on the new skin. This is the simplest method, and should be used if there have only been topology changes and the skin is otherwise very similar.

    NOTE:
        The methods below will leave a clear history of updates in the guides subnet, where all grooming happens.

    Transfer Direct (Changed Position):
        Use this if there has been a change in position/scale/sculpting while the topology has remained unchanged.

        Uses the Transfer Guides SOP to transfer an existing groom to a new skin. Existing grooming nodes are collapsed into a subnet and can still be edited.

    Transfer By UV (Changed Position and Topology):
        Use this if their has been a change in position/scale/sculpting and topology. This relies on a matching UV set between the current and new skin.

        This is the same as __Transfer Direct__, except it does the transfer using a UV set that exists on both the old and new model. This means that in addition to position changes, the topology can also be dramatically different between models.

UV Attribute:
    The UV Attribute to use when __Method__ is set to `Transfer By UV`.

Update From SOP:
    Update to a new skin geometry, using the options set above. This let's you pick a SOP to use as the new geometry.

== Render ==

Render Style:
    Controls how the fur is rendered in mantra.

    Procedural:
        Generate curves at render time using the fur procedural.
    Direct:
        Generate curves in Houdini before rendering and send the generated
        curves to mantra.

Phantom:
    #id: vm_phantom
    If enabled, this object will only cast shadows and reflections.

=== Mantra ===

Bounding Box:
    #id: vmproc_boxstyle
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for
    the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on
    screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set
    __Bounding box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which
    case mantra will always load the references geometry
    regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by
    referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__
    parameter.

SOP Bounds:
    #id: vmproc_soppath
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    #id: vmproc_minbound
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit
    bounds.

Max Bounds:
    #id: vmproc_maxbound
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit
    bounds.

Expand Bounds:
    #id: expandbounds
    Allows you to adjust the bounds of the bounding box to
    compensate for any fur that may have been moved outside of
    the original bounds by a shader.

=== Shading ===

Categories:
    #id: categories
    The categories defining the set membership of this object.

Reflection Mask:
    #id: reflectmask
    Space-separated list of objects to appear in reflections on this
    object. You can use wildcards (for example, `prop_*`) and
    [bundle references|/ref/panes/bundles]  to specify objects.

    You can also use the  [link editor
    pane|/ref/panes/linker]  to edit the
    relationships between objects using a graphical interface.


Refraction Mask:
    #id: refractmask
    Objects that will be refracted on this object.

Light Mask:
    #id: lightmask
    Space-separated list of names of lights that illuminate this
    object. You can use wildcards (for example, `key_*`) and
    [bundle references|/ref/panes/bundles]  to specify objects.

    You can also use the  [link editor
    pane|/ref/panes/linker]  to edit the
    relationships between lights and objects using a graphical
    interface.

Matte shading:
    #id: vm_matte
    Render the object as a cut-out matte.

Raytrace Shading:
    #id: vm_rayshade
    Shade every sample rather than shading micropolygon vertices.
    This setting enables the raytrace rendering engine on a
    per-object basis.

=== Sampling ===

Geometry Velocity Blur:
    #id: geo_velocityblur
    If enabled, this object's rendered motion blur will be based
    upon the vector attribute named `v` in the geometry. The units
    of the attribute are in (1 unit/sec).

    Velocity motion blur should be used if it contains changing
    point counts since it cannot be rendered correctly with
    deformation motion blur. For example, a particle system with
    changing particle counts should use this option.

    You can use Velocity blur on these types of objects as long as
    they have valid `v` attributes. Particles automatically have
    the `v` attribute so if you are rendering particles, simply
    enable this parameter.

=== Dicing ===

Shading Quality:
    #id: vm_shadingquality
    Shading Quality is used by micropolygon rendering to control
    the shading resolution. A value of 1 means that approximately
    1 micropolygon will be used per pixel. A higher value will
    generate smaller micropolygons meaning more shading and
    sampling will occur, but the quality will be higher.

Ray Shading Quality:
    #id: vm_rayshadingquality
    Ray Shading Quality is used by raytracing when rendering. When
    raytracing subdivision surfaces or patch surfaces (eg. NURBS),
    geometry dicing will occur similar to micropolygon rendering.
    This value functions similar to __Shading Quality__ for these
    primitives when raytracing.

    NOTE:
        Only when rendering subdivision surfaces and patch surfaces
        (eg. NURBS) will this setting have an effect.

Geometry Filter Width:
    #id: vm_geofilterwidth
    Geometry Filter Width sets a minimum rendering width in raster
    space for curves.  Any curve segment smaller than this value at
    the projected point will instead have its opacity scaled down as
    a ratio of the minimum width and the actual width.  This helps
    rendering very thin curves without having to adversely increase
    the pixel samples to compensate.

Dicing Flatness:
    #id: vm_flatness
    This property controls the tesselation levels for nearly flat
    primitives. By increasing the value, more primitives will be
    considered flat and will be sub-divided less.

Ray Predicing:
    #id: vm_raypredice
    This property will cause this object to generate all the
    micro-polygons before the render begins. Ray tracing can be
    significantly faster at the cost of potentially huge memory
    requirements.

Shade Curves As Surfaces:
    #id: vm_curvesurface
    When rendering a curve, turns the curve into a surface and dices
    the surface, running the surface shader on multiple points across
    the surface. This may be useful when the curves become curved
    surfaces, but is less efficient. The default is to simply run the
    shader on the points of the curve and duplicate those shaded
    points across the created surface.

=== Geometry ===

Backface Removal:
    #id: vm_rmbackface
    If enabled, geometry that are facing away from the camera are
    not rendered.

Polygons As Subdivision:
    #id: vm_rendersubd
    If enabled, polygon geometry rendered from this object will be
    rendered as a subdivision surface. 

Render As Points:
    #id: vm_renderpoints
    By default, points within particle system primitives are
    rendered as sphere primitives. If a point is not
    part of a particle system primitive, then it is not rendered.
    If this parameter is enabled, then all points (regardless if
    they are part of a particle system) from this object's geometry
    will be rendered as point (circle) primitives facing the camera
    plane.

Coving:
    #id: vm_coving
    Coving is the process of filling cracks in diced geometry
    at render time, where different levels of dicing side-by-side
    create gaps at T-junctions.

    The default setting, __Coving for displacement/sub-d__, only
    does coving for surfaces with a displacement shader and
    subdivision surfaces, where the displacement of points can
    potentially create large cracks. This is sufficient for more
    rendering, however you may want to use __Coving for all
    primitives__ if you are using a very low shading rate or see
    cracks in the alpha of the rendered image.

    Do not use __Disable coving__. It has no performance
    benefit, and may actually harm performance since Houdini has to
    render any geometry visible through the crack.

    This setting only applies to micropolygon rendering.

Automatically Compute Normals:
    #id: vm_computeN
    If enabled, smooth normals will we computed at render time if
    the normal (`N`) vector attribute does not exist.
