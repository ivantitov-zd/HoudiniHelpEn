= Agent attributes =

"""Useful attributes for reading in triggers, or that you can set to affect behavior."""

== Setting up attributes in the geometry network ==

Many of the these attributes are initialized by parameters on the [Crowd Source node|Node:sop/crowdsource], and can also be overridden on some or all agents.

* If you are using points as inputs to the Crowd Source node, crowd-related attributes on the points will be copied to the agents.

* Alternatively, you can apply attributes to the agent primitives created by the Crowd Source node using an [Attribute node|Node:sop/attribute] or [Attribute Wrangler|Node:sop/attribwrangle].

Note that the input to Crowd Source is points, but the output is (agent) primitives.

See also [how to change agent attributes as part of state behavior|states#attributes].

== Visualizing Attributes ==

You can also use the [group and attribute list|/basics/select#groups] in the
viewport to visualize agent attributes. Turn on the group list in the
[display options|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d] window. Then use the
[Smallicon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu to switch the group list to __Points__
mode. Then use the __Attributes__ submenu of the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/gear] gear
menu to choose an agent attribute to visualize. For example, visualizing the
`state` attribute will color each agent depending on the state it is currently
in. All walking agents will be one color, and all standing agents will be
another.

@attributes

Use the [geometry spreadsheet|/ref/panes/geosheet] to view the attributes of
agent primitives.

`agentgroup`:
    #type: string
    #on: point

    Created by the Crowd Source SOP when __Create Group__ is enabled. This attribute can be used to differentiate agents created from a particular source.

`agentname`:
    #type: string
    #on: point

    Unique identifier for the type of agent (the agent definition). For example, this could be `soldier` or `average_male`.

`Cd`:
    #type: vec3
    #on: point

    The visualization color for this particular agent in the viewport. This is useful to differentiate groups or individuals.

`heading`:
    #type: vec3
    #on: point

    The target direction that the agent should face.
    When using the crowd solver, `up` and `heading` describe the agent's target orientation, and `orient` is the agent's actual orientation. These may differ due to parameters such as the [max turn rate|Node:dop/crowdsolver#maxturnrate].

`id`:
    #type: int
    #on: point

    A unique number identifying this particular agent.

`maxturnrate`:
    #type: float
    #on: point

    The maximum rate (in degrees per second) at which agents will turn when driven by the solver's default movement behavior.
    This attribute will override the default max turn rate on the crowd solver.

`orient`:
    #type: quaternion
    #on: point

    The orientation of the agent.

`pscale`:
    #type: float
    #on: point

    The "radius" of the agent.

`state`:
    #type: string
    #on: point

    The name of the agent's current state, for example `walk`.

`stateduration`:
    #type: float
    #on: point

    The amount of time (in seconds) the agent has been in the current state.

`steerforce`:
    #type: float
    #on: point

    The amount of force to be applied by the solver to the agent in the current time step. Behavior nodes modify this value to move agents.

`steerforceweight`:
    #type: float
    #on: point

    The total [weight|weights] of all behavior nodes that have contributed to `steerforce`. The solver uses this to normalize the forces applied to the agent.

`up`:
    #type: vector
    #on: point

    The agent's up vector.
    When using the crowd solver, `up` and `heading` describe the agent's target orientation, and `orient` is the agent's actual orientation. These may differ due to parameters such as the [max turn rate|Node:dop/crowdsolver#maxturnrate].

`v`:
    #type: vector
    #on: point

    The current velocity of the agent.
