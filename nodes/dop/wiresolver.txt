= Wire Solver =

"""Sets and configures a Wire solver."""

The Wire Solver DOP sets objects to use the Wire solver.

If an object has this DOP as its `Solver` subdata, it will evolve itself
as a dynamic wire object.

This solver recognizes the following special subdata, if present:

* Wire Physical Parameters data with the name `PhysicalParms`

* Wire Elasticity data with the name `Elasticity`

* Wire Plasticity data with the name `Plasticity`

It also recognizes most standard subdata:

* Position data with the name `Position`

* Geometry data with the name `Geometry`

* constraint data

* force data

* collider data

* impact data

NOTE:
    If the value of a force, including gravity, is so small that if falls within the wire solver's __Solve Tolerance__ the solver will not apply the force. For example, the default L-system with __Point Attributes__ turned on is so light the wire solver will not apply gravity to it. You can decrease the __Solve Tolerance__ or increase the weight of your dynamic object to work around this.

TIP:
    Elasticity cannot be entirely removed from the wire solver's dynamics behavior. However, you can use a [Multiple Solver DOP|Node:dop/multisolver] to attach both a Wire Solver and [SOP Solver|Node:dop/sopsolver] to remove stretching by moving points.  For example, the [SOP Solver|Node:dop/sopsolver] could simply walk along each curve from root to tip and re-position each vertex so the length matches the rest length. However, the more the [SOP Solver|Node:dop/sopsolver] moves vertices to enforce the non-stretch constraint, the more the resulting dynamics will be affected.

    Artifacts from this two stage process can be reduced by increasing the __Sub Steps__ parameter on the DOP network. 

NOTE:
    The Wire Solver will constrain certain points if it finds a point attribute called `pintoanimation` or `gluetoanimation` on the Geometry subdata. This can be used to release point constraints on a per-point basis.

@parameters

== Integrator ==

These parameters control how the integrator determines substeps and overall dynamics.

Spatial Scale:
    #id: spatialscale
    Indicates the scale of the simulation. It is very important that you set this to the right value, otherwise the defaults for stiffness and damping will not work as expected.
	If you model your wire using meters, then the default value of 1 is sufficient. However, if you model your wire in centimeters, you should set __Spatial Scale__ to 0.01.
    NOTE:
	You should choose the correct __Unit Length__ in __Edit__ > __Preferences__ > __Hip File Options__ before you create your DOP network. That way, the wire solver node will automatically get the correct __Spatial Scale__ when it's created.

Minimum Substeps:
    #id: minsubsteps
    Limits the minimum number of substeps per timestep. Higher
    values may be more accurate, but may require more computation. 

Solve Tolerance:
    #id: tol
    Determines how close to the actual value the formula must solve before continuing to solve the next frame. 

    A smaller value will give higher quality, but will also run slower. A larger value will run faster, but may not be as accurate.

== Capabilities ==

These parameters control attribute creation on the wire object. 

Create Internal Force Attributes:
    If set, the wire solver will create attributes on each point
    showing the force applied to resist stretching and bending. 
    
    This is required for wire visualization to work, but can be disabled
    to save memory during simulation.

Create External Force Attributes:
    If set, the wire solver will create attributes on each point
    showing the force applied by Force DOPs, and applied to meet
    constraints, prevent collisions and create friction. 

    This is required for wire visualization to work, but can be disabled to
    save memory during simulation.

Enable Plastic Deformation:
    If set, the wire solver will create and modify attributes on Wire
    Object geometry for describing plastic deformation information.

Collision Handling:
    #id: collisionhandling

    Determines the collision detection and resolution strategy used by the
    wire solver.

    SDF:
	A strategy that supports SDF representations of rigid bodies.

    Local Geometric:
	A collision response strategy that ignores the influence of elements
	distant from the collision.  This strategy is faster that "Global
	Geometric" but may produce visual artifacts.

    Global Geometric:
	A collision response strategy that considers the influence of all
	elements.

== Accuracy ==

These parameters control the accuracy of the discovery and resolution of collisions.

Max Collision Resolve Passes:
    #id: resolvemaxpasses
    The maximum number of passes that are performed to resolve the collisions. When this number is set too low, there is a chance that not all collisions will be resolved, whch could result in visible penetrations.
