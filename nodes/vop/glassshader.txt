@parameters

== General ==

Roughness:
    #id: rough
    Controls how dull a surface appears. A value of `0.0` results in a smooth surface with perfectly sharp reflections. A value of `1.0` produces a completely dull surface. Under the hood, this simulates microscopic bumps which become more pronounced the higher the __Roughness__, causing reflected light to be scattered more.

IOR:
    #id: ior
    The index of refraction of the surface material.

Reflect Color:
    #id: reflcolor
    The color of reflections.

Refract Color:
    #id: refrcolor
    The color of refractions.

== Attenuation ==

Enable:
    #id: attenenable
    Tints light with the __Attenuation Color__ as it travels through the object.

Color:
    #id: attencolor
    The material's interior color to be used for tinting.

Attenuation Density:
    #id: attendensity
    The density of the interior, higher values tint more over a shorter distances.

== Fake Caustics ==

Enable:
    #id: fakecausticenable
    Fake caustic refractions by making the object semi-transparent.

Transmission Tint:
    #id: fakecaustictransmit
    #contentfrom: /nodes/vop/fakecaustics#transmit

Shadow:
    #id: fakecausticshadow
    #contentfrom: /nodes/vop/fakecaustics#shadow
