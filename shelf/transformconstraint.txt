"""Apply a transform as a constraint with an optional pivot."""

This tool will let you transform the current object and an optional pivot object.

== Creating a Transform Constraint ==

# Click ((LMB)) the [Icon:SOP/xform] Transform Constraint tool on the __Constraints__ tab.

# Select the object you want to transform and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

# Review the [Toolbar Parameters|#parameters] to select the pivot mode.

# Select the object for the pivot and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection or press ((Enter)) without a selection to continue without a pivot object.

This tool creates a new `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object, or reuses an existing one.

A [Transform CHOP|Node:chop/constrainttransform] is created based on the selected objects. The constraint is added after the the node that has the output flag and the output flag is moved to the new node.

@parameters Toolbar Parameters

    parameters or in global space using the third input. The Pivot Mode lets you use the position and/or orientation from the Input #3.
