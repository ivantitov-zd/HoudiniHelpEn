@methods

::`__init__(self, values=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0))`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::HOM_Vector3
    Return a new Vector3 from a sequence of floats.  If this method is called
    without parameters, the resulting vector contains the values (0.0, 0.0,
    0.0).

    You can also construct a Vector3 from a [Hom:hou.Vector4].  The result
    contains the first 3 values in the Vector4.

    Raises `InvalidSize` if `values` is not 3 elements long, or `TypeError`
    if `values` is not a sequence of floats.

::`__getitem__(self, index)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__getitem__
    Return the float component at the specified index.  This method makes
    vectors behave as sequences (so you can, for example, use a for loop
    on the elements of a vector, convert a vector to a tuple of floats, etc.)
    and lets you use square brackets to index into a vector.

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> v = hou.Vector3((1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
    >>> v[-1]
    3.0
    }}}

::`__setitem__(self, index, value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__setitem__
    This method lets you use square brackets to set a value on a vector.

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> v = hou.Vector3((1.5, 2.5, 3.5))
    >>> v[1] = 0.5
    >>> print v
    [1.5, 0.5, 3.5]
    }}}

::`setTo(self, sequence)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::setTo
    #replaces: Exp:vset
    Set the contents of this vector to a sequence of floats.

    Raises `InvalidSize` if `values` is not 3 elements long, or `TypeError`
    if `values` is not a sequence of floats or ints.

::`__len__(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__len__
    Returns 3.  This method lets you call len() on a Vector3.

::`__add__(self, vector3)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__add__
    Add two vectors, returning a new vector with each component equal to the
    sum of the corresponding components in the two vectors.  This method lets
    you write `v1 + v2`, where `v1` and `v2` are Vector3 objects.

    This method is equivalent to `hou.Vector3(self[0] + vector3[0],
    self[1] + vector3[1], self[2] + vector3[2])`.

::`__sub__(self, vector3)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__sub__
    Subtract a vector from another, returning a new vector with each component
    equal to the first vector's corresponding component minus the second
    vector's.  This method lets you write `v1 - v2`, where `v1` and `v2` are
    Vector3 objects.

    This method is equivalent to `hou.Vector3(self[0] - vector3[0],
    self[1] - vector3[1], self[2] - vector3[2])`.

::`__neg__(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__neg__
    Return a vector whose components contain the negative values of this
    vector's components.  This method lets you write `-v`, where `v` is a
    Vector3 object.

    This method is equivalent to `hou.Vector3(-self[0], -self[1], -self[2])`.

::`__mul__(self, scalar_or_matrix4)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__mul__
    #replaces: Exp:vscale
    Multiply this vector with a scalar or with a matrix, returning a new
    vector.  This method lets you write `v * s` or `v * m` where `v` is a
    vector, `s` is a float scalar, and `m` is a [Hom:hou.Matrix4].

    When the parameter is a float scalar `s`, this method is equivalent to
    `hou.Vector3(self[0] * s, self[1] * s, self[2] * s)`.

    In order multiply the Vector3 by a Matrix4, the Vector3 is converted to
    a Vector4 with the fourth component set to 1.0.  The effect is that the
    vector is treated as a position, so if the transformation matrix contains a
    translation component, the return value will be translated.  If you would
    like to transform a vector (so translations are ignored but rotations, for
    example, apply), you'll need to transform a corresponding [Hom:hou.Vector4]
    with the fourth component set to zero:
    {{{
    #!pycon
    # Build a transformation matrix that rotates 180 degrees about z and then translates by 1 in x.
    >>> matrix = hou.hmath.buildRotateAboutAxis((0, 0, 1), 180) * hou.hmath.buildTranslate((1, 0, 0))
    >>> position = hou.Vector3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)

    # Rotate the point (0,1,0) to (0,-1,0), then translate to (1,-1,0).
    >>> position * matrix
    <hou.Vector3 [1, -1, 0]>

    # Rotate the vector (0,1,0) to (0,-1,0), ignoring the translation.
    >>> vector = hou.Vector4(tuple(position) + (0.0,))
    >>> vector
    <hou.Vector4 [0, 1, 0, 0]>
    >>> vector * matrix
    <hou.Vector4 [0, -1, 0, 0]>
    >>> hou.Vector3(vector * matrix)
    <hou.Vector3 [0, -1, 0]>

    # We could have wrapped the above in a function:
    >>> def transformAsVector(vector3):
    ...     return hou.Vector3(hou.Vector4(tuple(vector3) + (0.0,)) * matrix)
    >>> transformAsVector(position)
    <hou.Vector3 [0, -1, 0]>

    # Change the Vector4's last component to 1 to illustrate that it's transformed as a point again.
    >>> vector[-1] = 1.0
    >>> vector
    <hou.Vector4 [0, 1, 0, 1]>
    >>> vector * matrix
    <hou.Vector4 [1, -1, 0, 1]>
    }}}

    See also [Hom:hou.Matrix4].

::`__rmul__(self, scalar)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__rmul__
    #replaces: Exp:vscale
    Multiply this vector with a scalar, returning a new vector.  This method
    lets you write `s * v`, where `v` is a vector and `s` is a float scalar.
    See also [Hom:hou.Vector3#__mul__], which lets you write `v * s`.

    {{{
    #!pycon
    >>> v = hou.Vector3(1, 2, 3)
    >>> v * 2
    <hou.Vector3 [2, 4, 6]>
    >>> 2 * v
    <hou.Vector3 [2, 4, 6]>
    }}}

::`__div__(self, scalar)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::__div__
    Divide a vector by a float scalar, returning a new vector.  This method
    lets you write `v / s` where `v` is a vector and `s` is a float.

    This method is equivalent to
    `hou.Vector3(self[0] / scalar, self[1] / scalar, self[2] / scalar)`.

::`length(self)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::length
    #replaces: Exp:vlength, Exp:length
    Interpret this vector as a direction vector and return its length.
    The result is the same as `math.sqrt(self[0]**2 + self[1]**2 + self[2]**2)`.

::`lengthSquared(self)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::lengthSquared
    #replaces: Exp:vlength2
    Interpret this vector as a direction vector and return the square of its
    length.  The result is the same as `self[0]**2 + self[1]**2 + self[2]**2`.

    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::normalized
    #replaces: Exp:normalize
    Interpret this vector as a direction and return a vector with the same
    direction but with a length of 1.

    If the vector's length is 0 (or close to it), the result is the original
    vector.

    For vectors with non-zero lengths, this method is equivalent to
    `self * (1.0/self.length())`.

::`multiplyAsDir(self, matrix4)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::multiplyAsDir
    Interpret this vector as a direction and returns a transformed direction
    that has been rotated and scaled (not translated) by the matrix4 

::`distanceTo(self, vector3)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::distanceTo
    #replaces: Exp:distance
    Interpret this vector and the argument as 3D positions, and return the
    distance between them.  The return value is equivalent to
    `(self - vector3).length()`.

::`dot(self, vector3)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::dot
    #replaces: Exp:dot
    Return the dot product between this vector and the one in the parameter.
    This value is equal to
    `self[0]*vector3[0] + self[1]*vector3[1] + self[2]*vector3[2]`, which is
    also equal to `self.length() * vector3.length() *
    math.cos(hou.hmath.degToRad(self.angleTo(vector3)))`

    See [Wikipedia's dot product page|Wp:Dot_product].

::`cross(self, vector3)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::cross
    #replaces: Exp:cross
    Return the cross product of this vector with another vector.  The
    return value is a vector that is perpendicular to both vectors, pointing
    in the direction defined by the right-hand rule, with length
    `self.length() * vector3.length() *     math.sin(hou.hmath.degToRad(self.angleTo(vector3)))`.

    See [Wikipedia's cross product page|Wp:Cross_product].

::`angleTo(self, vector3)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::angleTo
    #replaces: Exp:vangle
    Interprets this Vector3 and the parameter as directions and returns the
    angle (in degrees) formed between the two vectors when you place the
    origins at the same location.

::`angularVelocityTo(self, vector3, time_interval)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::angularVelocityTo
    #replaces: Exp:angvel
    #status: ni

::`clampLengthAsNew(self, min_length, max_length)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:

    #cppname: HOM_Vector3::isAlmostEqual

    `reference` while still describing the same orientation as this vector.

    reference:
        A [Hom:hou.Vector3] of Euler angles, in degrees. Typically, this will
        be the rotations from the previous sample or frame.
