"""Adjusts the head of an agent to look at a specific object or position."""

This node is used to modify the transform of the head bone of an agent to orient
it towards an object or position.

=== Attributes ===

This node requires the following attributes to be present on the input
geometry. These attributes can be created by the [Agent Prep
SOP|Node:sop/agentprep] or the [Crowd Source SOP|Node:sop/crowdsource].

@parameters

Group:
	The group of agents to modify.

Eye Offset:
	An offset to add to the head bone's position.

Horizontal Limit Angle:
	The maximum angle (in degrees) that the head can rotate horizontally.

Vertical Limit Angle:
	The maximum angle (in degrees) that the head can rotate vertically.

Limit Head Turn Per Frame:
	If enabled, limits how far the agent's head can rotate in a single frame. This causes the agent's head to gradually turn towards the target. If disabled, the agent's head will always look directly at the target position.

Head Turn Angle:
	The maximum angle (in degrees) that the agent's head can rotate by in a single frame if __Limit Head Turn Per Frame__ is enabled.

Look Ats:
	The objects or positions for the agents to look at. Each agent will choose the closest target that is within its field of view, and a new target will only be selected when the current target is no longer visible.

@inputs

Agents:
	The packed agent primitives to modify.

@outputs

Agents:
	The modified packed agent primitives.
