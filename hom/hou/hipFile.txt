@functions

::`basename()` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::basename
    Return only the filename portion of the current hip file.

::`name()` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::name
    Return the name of the current hip file.

    This function may or may not return a full path. If it's a relative path,
    then it is relative to `os.getcwd()`. If you need to always get a full
    path, use [Hom:hou.hipFile#path] instead.

::`path()` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::path
    Return a full path to the current hip file.

::`hasUnsavedChanges()` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::hasUnsavedChanges
    Returns whether the current Houdini session has been modified since
    it was last saved.  This function only works in a graphical session.
    In a non-graphical session it will always return True.

::`load(file_name, suppress_save_prompt=False, ignore_load_warnings=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::load
    #replaces: Cmd:mread
    Loads a hip file.

    If suppress_save_prompt is `False`, the function acts as if the
    file was loaded via __File > Open...__. It prompts you to save the
    current file before loading the new file and displays any load errors in
    a pop-up window. It also changes the name of the current file at the top
    of the main window and adds the file name to the list of most recently
    used files.
    
    If the UI is not available (for example, if you run the function from
    hython), the suppress_save_prompt parameter is ignored and non-
    interactive load is always performed.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the file to
    be loaded does not exist or cannot be opened. The same exception will
    also be raised if the method is called during shutting down or
    loading/saving a hip file. In each case, the exception instance message
    will reflect the failure reason.
    
    Raises [Hom:hou.LoadWarning] if warnings are
    generated during load and `ignore_load_warnings` is `False`. 
    The instance message will contain the warning text.

::`save(file_name=None, save_to_recent_files=True)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::save
    #replaces: Cmd:mwrite
    Saves the current session to a hip file.

    `file_name`:
        The name or path to the file that will be written.  If you attempt to
        save a file to a directory that does not exist, the directory will be
        created.  If this parameter is `None`, Houdini will use the current hip
        file path.
        
    `save_to_recent_files`:
        Whether Houdini will add this file to the contents of the __File > Open
        Recent Files__ list.  This parameter is ignored when this function is
        called from a non-graphical session.
    
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the target file or directory cannot be
    created or if other errors occur during save.  The same exception will also
    be raised if the method is called during shutting down or loading/saving a
    hip file. In each case, the exception instance message will reflect the
    failure reason.

::`setName(file_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::setName
    Changes the name of the current session for the next time it is saved to
    a hip file.

    `file_name` can either be an absolute or relative file path. If it's
    relative, then it is interpreted as being relative to `os.getcwd()`.

    If the user subsequently chooses __File > Save__, Houdini saves to a hip
    file with this name.  Note that this function does not actually save the
    hip file.  To both set the name of the current session and save it to a hip
    file, use [Hom:hou.hipFile#save].

::`saveAndIncrementFileName()`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::saveAndIncrementFileName
    #replaces: Cmd:mwrite
    Saves the current session to a hip file, automatically incrementing
    the file name.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the target
    file or directory cannot be created or if other errors occur during
    save. The same exception will also be raised if the method is called
    during shutting down or loading/saving a hip file. In each case, the
    exception instance message will reflect the failure reason.

::`saveAsBackup()`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::saveAsBackup
    #replaces: Cmd:mwrite
    Creates a numbered backup from the current session.

    If a file with the same name as the current backup already exists, then
    the backup is renamed to contain the next number in the sequence before
    saving. The backup files are saved in the directory set in the
    environment variable `HOUDINI_BACKUP_DIR`. If `HOUDINI_BACKUP_DIR` is not
    set, then a default relative directory called "backup" is used.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the target
    file or directory cannot be created or if other errors occur during
    save. The same exception will also be raised if the method is called
    during shutting down or loading/saving a hip file. In each case, the
    exception instance message will reflect the failure reason.

::`clear(suppress_save_prompt=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::clear
    #replaces: Cmd:mnew
    This function replaces the current session with an empty session.
    
    If `suppress_save_prompt` is set to `False`, the method acts as __File >
    New__ in an interactive session. It prompts you to save the current file
    before clearing. Otherwise, the session is cleared non-interactively: no
    prompts appear and any changes are discarded.
    
    If the UI is not available (for example, if you run the method from
    hython), the suppress_save_prompt parameter is ignored and non-
    interactive clear is always performed.

::`merge(file_name, node_pattern="*", overwrite_on_conflict=False, ignore_load_warnings=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::merge
    #replaces: Cmd:mread
    Merges the given file into the current hip file. The nodes to merge in
    are indicated by the node_pattern parameter.

    If `overwrite_on_conflict` is `True`, the method will
    overwrite nodes with the same name as nodes in the merge file.
    
    This method will raise a hou.OperationFailed exception if the file to
    be merged into the current one does not exist or cannot be opened. The
    same exception will also be raised if the method is called during
    shutting down or loading/saving a hip file. In each case, the exception
    instance message will reflect the failure reason.
    
    This method will raise a hou.LoadWarning exception if warnings are
    generated during merge and `ignore_load_warnings` is `False`. The instance
    message will contain the warning text.

::`collisionNodesIfMerged(file_name, node_pattern="*")` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::collisionNodesIfMerged
    Returns the Nodes that would collide if a merge was performed with the
    specified node_pattern.

    The result is a tuple of all Nodes in the merge file satisfying the
    node_pattern and having the same name as any of the existing nodes.
    
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the file to
    be used in the collision check does not exist, cannot be opened, or is
    not a valid hip file. The same exception will also be thrown if the
    method is called during shutting down or loading/saving a hip file. In
    each case, the exception instance message will reflect the failure
    reason.

::`isLoadingHipFile()` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::isLoadingHipFile
    #replaces: Exp:opisloading
    Return whether the main application is loading a hip file.

::`isShuttingDown()` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::isShuttingDown
    #replaces: Exp:opisquitting
    Return whether the main application is shutting down.

::`setOnSaveCallback(callback)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::setOnSaveCallback
    #status: ni

::`groupColorTable()` -> `dict` of `str` to [Hom:hou.Color]:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::groupColorTable
    Returns a dictionary of color overrides for the viewport group list.
    The viewport group list automatically assigns colors to groups based on a
    hash of the group name. The group color table is a dictionary of overrides
    to these default color assignments. This allows particular important
    groups to be assigned distinctive colors. The group color table is saved
    with the hip file. The color table can be modified with
    [Hom:hou.hipFile#setGroupColorTable].

::`setGroupColorTable(color_table)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::setGroupColorTable
    Sets a dictionary of color overrides for the viewport group list.
    The viewport group list automatically assigns colors to groups based on a
    hash of the group name. The group color table is a dictionary of overrides
    to these default color assignments. This allows particular important
    groups to be assigned distinctive colors. The group color table is saved
    with the hip file. The current color table can be queried with
    [Hom:hou.hipFile#groupColorTable].

    The supplied `color_table` must be a `dict` of `str` to [Hom:hou.Color]. The
    following example will cause groups names 'special_group' to appear with a
    red overlay:
    {{{
    #!python
    color_table = { 'special_group' : hou.Color([1,0,0]) }
    hou.hipFile.setGroupColorTable(color_table)
    }}}

::`saveMode(self)` -> [Hom:hou.saveMode]:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::saveMode
    Return the save mode of the current scene, either [Hom:hou.saveMode#Binary]
    or [Hom:hou.saveMode#Text].

::`setSaveMode(self, save_mode)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::setSaveMode
    Set the save mode of the current scene to either [Hom:hou.saveMode#Binary] or
    [Hom:hou.saveMode#Text].

::`importFBX(file_name, suppress_save_prompt=False, merge_into_scene=True, import_cameras=True, import_joints_and_skin=True, import_geometry=True, import_lights=True, import_animation=True, import_materials=True, resample_animation=False, resample_interval=1.0, override_framerate=False,framerate=-1, hide_joints_attached_to_skin=True, convert_joints_to_zyx_rotation_order=False, material_mode=hou.fbxMaterialMode.FBXShaderNodes, compatibility_mode=hou.fbxCompatibilityMode.Maya, single_precision_vertex_caches=False, triangulate_nurbs=False, triangulate_patches=False, import_global_ambient_light=False, import_blend_deformers_as_blend_sops=False, segment_scale_already_baked_in=True, convert_file_paths_to_relative=True, unlock_geometry=False, unlock_deformations=False, import_nulls_as_subnets=False, import_into_object_subnet=True, convert_into_y_up_coordinate_system=False)` -> ([Hom:hou.ObjNode], `str`):
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::importFBX
    #replaces: Cmd:fbximport
    Imports an FBX file with various options. It is recommended to always call this function with keyword arguments. Please see the [__File > Import > Filmbox FBX__ | /ref/windows/import_fbx] dialog help for a description of the options.

    If suppress_save_prompt is `False`, the function acts as if the
    file was loaded via __File > Open...__. It prompts you to save the
    current file before loading the new file and displays any load errors in
    a pop-up window. It also changes the name of the current file at the top
    of the main window and adds the file name to the list of most recently
    used files.
    
    If the UI is not available (for example, if you run the function from
    hython), the suppress_save_prompt parameter is ignored and non-
    interactive load is always performed.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the file to
    be loaded does not exist or cannot be opened. The same exception will
    also be raised if the method is called during shutting down or
    loading/saving a hip file. In each case, the exception instance message
    will reflect the failure reason.
    
    This function returns a tuple consisting the parent subnet node of the
    imported FBX nodes (or `hou.node('/obj')` if `import_into_object_subnet` is
    `False`) and a string containing the generated load messages.

::`addEventCallback(self, callback)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::addEventCallback
    Register a Python callback to be called whenever a .hip file event occurs
    (i.e. file load, file save).

    callback:
        Any callable Python object that expects one argument.
        The argument is an [Hom:hou.hipFileEventType] enum value.
    
    See [how to write a scene event callback|/hom/locations#scene_events] for more information.

    {{{
    #!python
    def scene_event_callback(event_type):
        hou.ui.displayMessage("An event of type {} occured".format(event_type))

    hou.hipFile.addEventCallback(scene_event_callback)
    }}}

::`removeEventCallback(callback)`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::removeEventCallback
    Remove a Python callback that was previously registered with
    [Hom:hou.hipFile#addEventCallback].  See [Hom:hou.hipFile#addEventCallback]
    for more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the callback was not previously
    registered.

::`clearEventCallbacks()`:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::clearEventCallbacks
    Remove all Python callbacks that have been registered with
    [Hom:hou.hipFile#addEventCallback].

::`eventCallbacks()` -> `tuple` of callback:
    #cppname: HOM_hipFile::eventCallbacks
    Return a tuple of all the Python callbacks that have been registered with
    [Hom:hou.hipFile#addEventCallback].
