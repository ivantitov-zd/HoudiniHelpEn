= Agent Terrain Adaptation =

"""Adapts the legs of an agent to conform to terrain."""

This node is used as part of a crowd simulation to modify the transforms of 
agent leg bones to avoid intersection with terrain.

@parameters

Group:
    Specifies a group of agents that this node should affect.

Activation:
    Whether or not to activate this node.

Terrain Object:
    Path to the terrain geometry object.

Lean Angle Per Frame:
    #id: leanangle
    When navigating uneven terrain, the agent can lean forwards or backwards. This parameter specifies the maximum angle (in degrees) that the agent can tilt by in a single frame.

Backward Lean:
    #id: backwardlean
    Specifies how far (in degrees) the agent can lean backward.

Forward Lean:
    #id: forwardlean
    Specifies how far (in degrees) the agent can lean forward.

Ankle Offset:
    #id: ankleoffset
    The vertical offset to apply when raying the terrain below the ankle for 
    checking intersection.

Toe Offset:
    #id: toeoffset
    The vertical offset to apply when raying the terrain below the toe for
    checking intersection.

@inputs

Agent:
    The packed primitive agent to modify. 

@outputs

Agent:
    The modified packed primitive agent with terrain adaptation applied.
