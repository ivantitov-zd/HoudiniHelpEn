"""A microsolver that removes the divergent components of a velocity
field."""

The Gas Project Non Divergent Variational DOP is a microsolver used in building
larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that
allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to
extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Project Non Divergent Variational DOP removes any divergent portions of
a velocity field. These are parts of the velocity field that represent
expansion or contraction. This is done by computing a pressure field
that counteracts any compression or rarefication and applying that
pressure field instantaneously.

This differs from the Gas Project Non Divergent DOP in that it considers
fractional voxel coverage of voxels.  This allows for much better computation
of velocity fields along sloped boundaries, avoiding the staircasing effects
otherwise found.

NOTE:
    The [Curl Noise POP|Node:pop/curlnoise] is often used with this node in FLIP fluid simulations, because it plays very predictably with any fluid simulations that contain the Gas Project Non Divergent DOP.


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to make divergence free. This must be a
        vector field.
    Surface Field:
        An SDF that specifies which voxels are to be considered in the
        divergence calculations. Voxels are either inside (less than 0)
        or outside. Incompressibility is only enforced on the interior
        voxels.
    Surface Weights Field:
        This field stores what percentage of each voxel is inside the
        surface field.  It is usually computed with a [Gas SDF To Fog DOP|Node:dop/gassdftofog].
        This field should match the size and sampling of the velocity field.
    Surface Pressure Field:
	This field can be used to apply non-zero pressure at the free surface.
	Surface pressure can be used to simulate phenomena like surface
	tension. This field should match the size and sampling of the surface
	field.
    Collision Field:
        Velocity values on collision boundaries are considered fixed.
    Collision Weights Field:
	This field stores what percentage each voxel is inside the
	collision objects.  It is usually computed with a [Gas SDF To Fog DOP|Node:dop/gassdftofog].
    Collision Velocity Field:
	The velocity of each voxel in the collision object.  If not provided,
        the collision velocities will be assumed to be zero.
    Goal Divergence Field:
        While the ostensible purpose of this micro solver is to remove
        divergence, one may want instead to make a field match a
        certain divergence pattern.

        The goal divergence field is a
        scalar field which will be matched.  If not specified, a zero
        field is used, thereby having the equivalent of no-divergence.
        The field is scaled by the surface area of the voxels so can
        be specified independently of the resolution of the actual gas
        geometry.

        NOTE:
            The Gas Advection micro solver relies on the field
            being non-divergent. Divergent fields may be inconsistent and
            not exhibit the proper rarefication/compression of scalar
            fields.  One can add in the rarefication/compression step by
            using a Gas Velocity Stretch micro solver on the density field
            using the modified velocity field as a reference.
    Pressure Field:
        The pressure required to make the velocity field divergence
        free is output into this field.
    Density Field:
	A field that gives the relative inertia of each voxel, allowing
	for proper velocity projection taking different density fluids
	into consideration.  Not to be confused with the density field
	in smoke simulations, the values here will be clamped within the
        range specified by __Min Density__ and __Max Density__.
    Min Density:
        The values specified in the __Density__ field will be lower-clamped
        to this value, specified in kilograms / meters^3.
    Max Density:
        The values specified in the __Density__ field will be upper-clamped
        to this value, specified in kilograms / meters^3.
    Error Tolerance:
        How much error to allow in solving the pressure equations.
        Smaller errors will take longer to converge but produce
        more accurate results.
    Surface Extrapolation Cells:
        Extrapolate the surface field into any collision objects if they
        are within this fraction of a voxel.  This can provide more stable
        collisions along curved surfaces, although it can also introduce
        a small amount of stickiness into the fluid-solid collision.
    Use Preconditioner:
	During the pressure projection solve the matrices involved can be
	preconditioned to greatly speed up the solution.  However, this is a
	single threaded process.  On machines with 4+ sockets it may be faster
	to use the simpler Jacobi preconditioner which multithreads well, but
	takes 6x more iterations to converge.  Setting Use Preconditioner
	corresponds to the Modified Incomplete Cholesky option of the Gas
	Project Non Divergent DOP, while not setting it corresponds to the
	Jacobi Preconditioner.
    Use OpenCL:
        Solve the linear system for pressure using OpenCL. This setting can accelarate high resolution fluid simulations when run on a fast GPU.
    Use Waterline:
	A closed boundary can be set as an open boundary above a specified waterline.
	The height of the waterline boundary at a particular boundary voxel
	is described by the waterline level and the waterline "up" direction.
