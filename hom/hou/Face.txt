"""A Face is a kind of geometry primitive (Prim object) that contains a
sequence of vertices (Vertex objects).  How these vertices are used depends on
the type of face; polygons, for example, use the vertices to define the
edges of the polygon, while NURBS curves use them as control points."""

A [Hom:hou.Surface], on the other hand, stores a two dimension grid of
vertices, and might be a NURBS surface, Bezier surface, or quadrilateral mesh.

@methods

::`addVertex(self, point)` -> [Hom:hou.Vertex]:
    #cppname: HOM_Face::addVertex
    Create a new vertex inside this face, adding it to the end of the vertex
    list.  You would typically call this method from the code of a
    Python-defined SOP.

    `point` is a [Hom:hou.Point] object that the new vertex will refer to.  See
    [Hom:hou.Vertex] for information on the relationship between points and
    vertices.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

::`isClosed(self) -> bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Face::isClosed
    #replaces: Exp:isclosed
    Return whether the first and last vertex are connected.

    An open face forms a multi-segment line or curve, since the first and last
    vertices are not connected.  A closed face forms a very thin surface.

::`setIsClosed(self, on)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Face::setIsClosed
    Set whether the face is open or closed.  See [Hom:hou.Face#isClosed] for
    more information.  You would typically call this method from the code of a
    Python-defined SOP.

    Note that this method will raise [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] on a Bezier
    curve.  See [Hom:hou.Geometry#createBezierCurve] for more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

::`setOpen(self, on)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Face::setOpen
    #status: ni

::`normal(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Face::normal
    Return the vector that's perpendicular to the face.

::`positionAt(self, u)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Face::positionAt
    #replaces: Exp:primuv
    Given a normalized (i.e. from 0 to 1) u value, return the position
    of the curve at that parametric location.

::`attribValueAt(self, attrib_or_name, u, du=0)` -> `int`, `float`, `str` or `tuple`:
    #cppname: HOM_Face::attribValueAt
    #replaces: Exp:primuv
    Return an attribute value at a normalized u parametric position on
    the curve.  If du is 0, returns the interpolated attribute value;
    otherwise, returns the derivative of the attribute value.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the attribute is not a point or vertex
    attribute.  If you want a primitive attribute value, it doesn't vary across
    the surface, so use [Hom:hou.Prim#attribValue].

::`degree(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Face::degree
    #replaces: Exp:degree
    #status: ni

::`arcLength(self, u_start, u_stop)`:
