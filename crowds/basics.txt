*Agents* are character skeletons with skin geometry and animation, each related to a *particle-like point* in a DOP simulation. Agents have a current *state*. A state corresponds to a *clip* that animates the agent while it's in that state. A state also contains *behavior nodes* that modify the agent, such as DOP particle forces that move the agent's point. At each simulation step, Houdini evaluates *triggers* for each agent. If a trigger matches for an agent, it activates a *transition* node that gives the agent a new current state.

For example, to have a crowd mill about, you could have some agents in a `walk` state and some in an `idle` state. The walk state would have behavior nodes inside to move the point of an agent in that state. A trigger could check if each agent has been in its current state for longer than a certain period. The trigger could lead to two transition nodes (walk -> idle and idle -> walk) to flip the state of each matching agent.

Crowds are created from points in a [geometry network|setup#geo], where you can use the full power of Houdini' geometry nodes and create agent positions from existing models such as terrain. The actual crowd simulation runs in a [simulation network|setup#dops], where the agents can [interact|interaction] with other dynamic elements.

See [how to set up a crowd simulation|setup] for information on how to use the shelf tools and the network editor to create a basic crowd simulation.

== Concepts ==

[Source points|setup]:
    The "source" for a crowd simulation is points in a geometry network, representing the starting location of the agents in the simulation.
    
    However, if you don't give it source points, the [Crowd Source surface node|Node:sop/crowdsource] will randomly scatter a certain number of points over a given area automatically.

[Agents|agents]:
    [Agents|/crowds/agents] are the "actors" of the crowd simulation, for example individual people in a crowd scene. An agent gets its look from a Houdini object subnet or asset containing the agent's skeleton and geometry. Before you can use a piece of character animation you must [bake the animation|clips] to disk.

    Each agent is created from a _source point_, defining the agent's initial location. The [Crowd Source node|Node:] converts points to special _agent primitives_, with primitive attributes containing information used by the crowd solver. The agent's baked geometry is loaded as a [packed primitive|/model/packed], so displaying and rendering large number of agents is still fast.

    See [setup|setup] for how to create an initial crowd simulation.

[Terrain|terrain]:
    Houdini currently supports a single terrain object (a static RBD object). Agents will follow the terrain, with optional IK foot adaptation.
