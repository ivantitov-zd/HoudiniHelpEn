= UV Unwrap =

"""Separates UVs into reasonably flat, non-overlapping groups."""

Given a set of planes, this operation will project each input primitive
onto the plane which will cause the least distortion in the shape. The
planes can either be specified with one of the default sets or else
provided through the second input.

In addition, polygons are grouped into regions of connected polygons
that map to the same plane. These regions are then laid out to avoid
overlapping.

This provides a good starting point for very complex geometry that doesn't work very well with projection mapping. Once you have broken up the UVs with this node, you can use [UV Edit|Node:sop/uvedit],
[UV Transform|Node:sop/uvtransform], and [UV Fuse|Node:sop/uvfuse] to
piece the UVs back together.

NOTE:
    This operation generates vertex UV coordinates.

@parameters
    UV Attribute:
        #id: uvattrib

        The name of the texture coordinate attribute to unwrap, defaulting to `uv`.
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to apply texture to.
    Plane Group:
        Subset of second input polygons to use as planes.
    Planes:
        Default plane orientations.
    Layout:
        How to lay the regions out.
    Scale:
        Type of scale to apply after the projection and layout.
    Spacing:
        #channels: /spacing

        Percentage of the laid out space to leave between adjacent
        regions.
    Rotate Order:
        Order of rotations.
    Rotate:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz
