= Constraint Network Relationship =

"""Defines a set of constraints based on geometry."""

The constraint network relationship is a low level tool to define constraints
based on geometry.

The [Constraint Network DOP|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] should likely be used
instead of building from this node.

__Geometry__ subdata attached to this node will specify the constraint network.
Like all relationships, a solver can be added to run a per frame solver on the
relationship.
