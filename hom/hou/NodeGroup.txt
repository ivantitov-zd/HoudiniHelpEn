"""Represents a node group."""

In Houdini, a node group contains a set of nodes from the same network.
Each group is named, and you can edit a group's contents from the network
view pane by selecting __Viewing Controls > Show Groups__ from its right-mouse
menu.

A node bundle, on the other hand, may contain nodes from multiple networks,
and corresponds to a [Hom:hou.NodeBundle] object.  You can edit a node bundle
from the bundle list pane.

@methods

::`name(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeGroup::name
    Returns the name of this group.

::`parent(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeGroup::parent
    Returns the network node containing this group.

::`nodes(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeGroup::nodes
    #replaces: Cmd:opgls
    Return a tuple containing the nodes in this group.

::`addNode(self, node)`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeGroup::addNode
    #replaces: Cmd:opgop
    Add a [Hom:hou.Node] to this group.

    If the node is already in the group, this method does nothing.  If the node
    is not in the correct network for this group, raises
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].

::`removeNode(self, node)`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeGroup::removeNode
    #replaces: Cmd:opgop
    Remove a [Hom:hou.Node] from this group.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node is not in the group.

::`clear(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeGroup::clear
    #replaces: Cmd:opgop
    Remove all nodes from this group.

::`destroy(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeGroup::destroy
    #replaces: Cmd:opgrm
    Delete this group.  Does not delete the nodes that were contained in it.

::`asCode(self, save_creation_commands=False, function_name=None)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeGroup::asCode
    #replaces: Cmd:opscript
    Returns the Python code necessary to recreate this group.

    save_creation_commands:
	Generate a creation script for the node group.  If set to False (the
	default), the generated script assumes that the node group already
	exists.  When set to True, the script will begin by creating the node
	group.
        
    function_name:
	If a function_name is specified, the output will be wrapped in a Python
	function.
