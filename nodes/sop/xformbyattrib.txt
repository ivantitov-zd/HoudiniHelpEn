= Transform By Attribute =

"""Transforms the input geometry by a point attribute."""

Unlike the [Transform SOP|Node:sop/xform], the transform applied to each point
will be different, and be governed by a point attribute.

This is useful to apply a deformation to all attribute types. An [Attribute VOP SOP|Node:sop/attribvop] may be used to create a deformation attribute, and then this node can apply it to the relevant attribute types.

Primitives attached to the points will also by transformed, allowing volumes and packed primitives to transform as expected.

A deformer can either be written by leaving `P` unaffected and generating a full 4x4 matrix on each point in VOPs.  Then this node will perform the actual deformation across all attribute types.  You can also deform `P` in the VOP code, but output a 3x3 matrix representing the local derivatives of the transform, allowing vectors such as `up` and `v`
to properly reorient.  If you want to enforce a pure rotation, use the `polardecomp` function.

@parameters

Group:
    Point group to transform.

Group Type:
    The type of elements referenced in the __Group__ field.

Transform Attribute:
	A point attribute to use as the transform at each point.

	This should be a float attribute.  The size of the attribute
	determines the type of transformation.

	3:
	    Translation by a delta.  Only affects Point and HPoint attributes.
	4:
	    Rotation by a quaternion.  Does not affect Point or HPoint attributes.
	9:
	    Multiplication by a 3x3 transform matrix.  Does not affect Point or HPoint attributes.
	16:
	    Multiplication by a 4x4 transform matrix.
	    4x4 detail attributes are also supported.

Attributes to Transform:
	Point and Vertex attributes that match this pattern will be
	transformed.  Their Type Info will be used to determine how
	they should transform, as points, vectors, and normals
	all need different operations.

	If `P` matches this string, then primitive transforms will
	also be rotated.

	In no case is the transform attribute itself transformed.

Invert Transformation:
    #id: invertxform

    When enabled, the inverse of the transform will be applied, instead of
    the transform itself.

Recompute Affected Normals:
	Recomputes any normals that are affected by polygons that use both
	transformed and untransformed points. When transforming the full
	geometry or full connected components, the results should be the same
	as when this option is off, i.e. the normals will just be transformed
	and not recomputed. This does nothing if `P` is not being transformed.

Preserve Normal Length:
        Normal lengths remain unaffected.

Delete Transform Attribute:
	The transform attribute is deleted after being used.
