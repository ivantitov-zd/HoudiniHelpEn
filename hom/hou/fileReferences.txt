:usage: `fileReferences(project_dir_variable='HIP', include_all_refs=true)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Parm] and `str` tuples

Returns a sequence of tuples representing _all_ references to external files (such as textures, geometry files, and asset libraries) in the current scene.

The first item in each tuple is a [Hom:hou.Parm] object representing the parameter containing the file reference, and the second item is the path string. (The second item is a convenience; you can get the same string by calling `Parm.unexpandedString()`.)

This can be useful when "preflighting", to check that there are no references to files outside `$HIP`.

{{{
#!python
import os

hipdir = os.environ["HIP"]

for parm, path in hou.fileReferences():
    # Assume you have a function to check if one path is the descendent
    # of another path
    if not is_inside(hipdir, path):
        print("Problem: path %s is not inside the project dir %s" % (path, hipdir)
}}}

(The sequence does not include default images and geometry files from inside Houdini's install location, for example `default.bgeo` in a [File SOP|Node:sop/file].)

`project_dir_variable`:
    You can specify the name of an environment variable. If an asset path starts with the variable, it will be replaced with a variable reference in the path string returned by this function.
    
    For example, if `$JOB` is `/mnt/projects/` and an asset is in `/mnt/projects/tool.hda`, if you call `hou.fileReferences("JOB")`, it will return the path as `$JOB/tool.hda`.

`include_all_refs`:
    If this is True, then the the function will return all the file references. 
    If this is False, then the function will return only the selected file references.
