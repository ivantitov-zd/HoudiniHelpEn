= Channel =

"""Creates channels from the value of its parameters."""

This CHOP allows you to create channels that replicate the values of its
parameters through time. Each channel can be named and assigned a
different value. The parameter is then evaluated for each frame in the
scene file.

This operator can be created from existing channel groups by
clicking ((RMB)) the name in the __Channel Groups__ list and choosing
__Motion Effects__ > __Create Clip__.


@parameters

    == Data ==

        Show All Parameters:
            Disabling this toggle simplifies the interface to make the parameters
            and the values easier to work with. Disable this after the channels
            have been setup to remove controls that are no longer needed.
        Copy to Exports:
            Copies the animation from the value parameters to the
            channel export parameters.
        Copy from Exports:
            Copies the animation to the value parameters from the
            channel export parameters.
        Channel Names from Exports:
            Sets the names of the value parameters to the names of
            the channel export parameters.
        Sort Channels:
            Sort all the channel by their name.
        Reset All Channels:
            Removes the animation on all the channel values and reset everything to zero.
        One Key Per Sample:
            Instead of evaluating the value parameter every frame,
            create the channel such that each sample corresponds to a
            key on the value parameter. This is only meaningful if the
            value parameter is animated.
        Add Node Name Dependencies:
            If set, this will cause the names specified in the Name parameter
            to be treated as real parameter paths and have name dependencies
            built for them. Then if the referenced nodes are renamed, the
            paths in the Name parameter will update accordingly.
        Number of Channels:
            Number of channels to create.
        Name:
            Name of the channel to create. If the size is greater than
            1, then the letter x,y,z, or w is appended to the channel
            name depending on if it is the first, second, third, or
            fourth component of the value parameter respectively.
        Type:
            Type of channel to create.

            Float:
                Regular float parameter
            Euler Rotation:
                A quaternion attribute is added to the three generated
                channels.
        Rotate Order:
            If the type is Euler Rotation, this parameter specifies the
            order of rotation.
        Size:
            Number of components. If the type is Euler Rotation, this
            parameter has no effect since 3 components must be
            generated.
        Value:
            The values of the channels.

    == Channel ==

        Channel Range:
            Specifies the range of data to generate.

            Use Full Animation Range:
                All of the animated range.
            Use Current Frame:
                Only the sample at the current frame.
            Use Start/End:
                The range is specified from the __Start__ and __End__
                parameters.
            Use Value Animation:
                The range is taken from range of keys available in the
                evaluated Value parameters.
        Start:
            #channels: /start

            The start time of the channel range.
        End:
            #channels: /end

            The end time of the channel range.
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample rate of the CHOP.
        Extend Left:
            The left extend condition (before the CHOP's start).
        Extend Right:
            The right extend condition (after the CHOP's end).
        Default Value:
            #channels: /defval

            The value to use for the "Default Value" extend condition
            type.
