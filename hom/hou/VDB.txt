@methods

::`sample(self, position)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::sample
    Given a sequence of three floats containing a 3D position, return the value
    of the volume at that position.  If the position is not in the middle of
    a voxel, Houdini will interpolate using values from surrounding voxels.

    See also [Hom:hou.VDB#voxel] and [Hom:hou.VDB#posToIndex].

::`gradient(self, position)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::gradient
    Given a sequence of three floats containing a 3D position, return a
    vector which points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase
    of the volume's value.

    See [Wikipedia's gradient page|Wp:Gradient] for more information.

::`voxel(self, index)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::voxel
    Given a sequence of three integers containing a voxel index, return the
    value of the corresponding voxel.

::`resolution(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::resolution
    Return the x, y, and z dimensions of [Hom:hou.VDB#activeVoxelBoundingBox].
    Since VDB volumes are sparse, this represents the virtual resolution of all
    the voxels which have data (or are "active").

::`indexToPos(self, index)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::indexToPos
    Given a sequence of three ints containing an index into the voxel array,
    return the corresponding 3D position of the middle of that voxel.

::`posToIndex(self, position)` -> `tuple` of `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::posToIndex
    Given a sequence of three floats containing a 3D position, return a tuple
    of three ints containing the corresponding index into the voxel array.

::`isSDF(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::isSDF
    Return whether or not the volume should be semantically treated as a signed
    distance field. If true, the volume can be thought of as representing a
    closed surface, where the negative voxel values are inside, the positive
    voxel values are outside, and voxels on the surace are zero.

    For VDB volumes, there is typically only a 3 voxel radius around the
    surface where there exists data.

::`transform(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Matrix3]:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::transform
    Return a 3x3 matrix containing the scale and rotation transformations
    for this volume.

    Note that the position information for the volume can be obtained by
    calling `volume.vertex(0).point().position()`.

    The following function returns a 4x4 transformation matrix for the volume
    that includes the translation:
    {{{
    #!python
    def fullTransform(volume):
	return (hou.Matrix4(volume.transform()) *
	    hou.hmath.buildTranslate(volume.vertex(0).point().position()))
    }}}

    NOTE:
        You need to get the object node's transform to get to worldspace.

::`taper(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::taper
    Returns the taper value of the volume's transform. For untapered
    transforms, this value will be 1.

::`isEmpty(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::isEmpty
    Returns whether the VDB volume has no data.

::`activeVoxelCount(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::activeVoxelCount
    Returns the number of active voxels in the volume.

::`activeVoxelBoundingBox(self)` -> `hou.BoundingBox`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::activeVoxelBoundingBox
    Returns the smallest exclusive bounding box within the VDB volume that has
    active voxels.

::`voxelSize(self)` -> `hou.Vector3`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::voxelSize
    Returns the size of voxels within the VDB volume. All voxels will be of
    this size for untapered volumes. For tapered volumes, this size represents
    the size of voxel at the origin of the frustum.

::`dataType(self)` -> `hou.vdbData`:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::dataType
    Returns the voxel data type within the VDB volume.

::`voxelRange(self, range)` -> tuple of bool, float, int, or hou.Vector3:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::voxelRange
    Return a tuple containing the values of all voxels withing a bounding box
    range.  It is faster to call this method to retrieve all the voxels than it
    is to loop through the voxel array in Python.

    The result voxel type is determine by the underlying [Hom:hou.VDB#dataType].

    This method can be approximately implemented as follows (though this Python
    implementation is much slower):
    {{{
    #!python
    def allVoxels(self):
	result = []
	xres, yres, zres = self.activeVoxelBoundingBox()
	for z in range(zres):
	    for y in range(yres):
		for x in range(xres):
		    result.append(self.voxel((x, y, z)))
	return tuple(result)
    }}}

::`voxelRangeAsBool(self, range)` -> tuple of bool:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::voxelRange
    Return a tuple containing the values of all voxels withing a bounding box
    range.  It is faster to call this method to retrieve all the voxels than it
    is to loop through the voxel array in Python.

    See help for [Hom:hou.VDB#voxelRange] for implementation details.

::`voxelRangeAsFloat(self, range)` -> tuple of float:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::voxelRange
    Return a tuple containing the values of all voxels withing a bounding box
    range.  It is faster to call this method to retrieve all the voxels than it
    is to loop through the voxel array in Python.

    See help for [Hom:hou.VDB#voxelRange] for implementation details.

::`voxelRangeAsInt(self, range)` -> tuple of int:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::voxelRange
    Return a tuple containing the values of all voxels withing a bounding box
    range.  It is faster to call this method to retrieve all the voxels than it
    is to loop through the voxel array in Python.

    See help for [Hom:hou.VDB#voxelRange] for implementation details.

::`voxelRangeAsVector3(self, range)` -> tuple of hou.Vector3:
    #cppname: HOM_VDB::voxelRange
    Return a tuple containing the values of all voxels withing a bounding box
    range.  It is faster to call this method to retrieve all the voxels than it
    is to loop through the voxel array in Python.
