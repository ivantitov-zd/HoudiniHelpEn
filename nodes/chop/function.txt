"""Provides more complicated math functions than found in the Math CHOP such as trigonometic functions, logarithmic functions, and exponential functions."""

This CHOP provides more complicated math functions than found in the
Math CHOP such as trigonometic functions, logarithmic functions and exponential
functions. Since many of these functions can produce math errors, an error handling tab is provided for error handling and recovery.

Most of the functions require only one parameter, and they are applied
as a unary operator to each input channel. Some functions take two
parameters, and these require the use of the second input. The first
parameter, X, is always a value from a channel in the first input. The
second parameter, Y, is a value from a corresponding channel in the
second input. Channels from each input are paired by name or index.

Errors can be handled by replacing the bad sample with a pre-defined
value or by using the value of the previous sample. Alternatively,
cooking can be aborted upon error for debugging networks.


@parameters

== Function ==

Function:
    Which math function to apply to the channels. All of the
    functions are unary functions except for the binary
    functions `Arctan (Input1/Input2)` and `Input1 ^ Input2`.
    
Base Value:
    #channels: /baseval

    The value of the base for `Log base N` and `Base ^ Input1`.
    
Exponent Value:
    #channels: /expval

    The value of the exponent for `Input1 ^ Exponent`.
    
Angle Units:
    For trigonometric functions, the angles can be measured in Degrees, Radians, or Cycles (`0` to `1`).
    
Match By:
    How to pair channels together from the two inputs for the
    binary functions, by name or by channel index.
    
Match Failure:
    It is sometimes desirable to produce a warning or an error
    when channels in the first input fail to be correctly matched
    to channels in the other inputs. A failure may occur when
    matching by __Channel Number__ if input 1 has more channels than
    the input 2 or when matching by __Channel Name__ if a channel name
    in input 1 cannot be found in input 2.

== Error ==

Error Handling:
    How to correct samples with math errors.

    Abort With Error Message:
        Cooking aborts.
        
    Replace With Specified Values:
        Values specified below.
        
    Use The Previous Value:
        Uses the last good result.
        
Plus Infinity Value:
    #channels: /pinfval

    Value to use when an infinity error occurs. Caused by `sinh()`, `cosh()` and `tan()`.
    
Minus Infinity Value:
    #channels: /ninfval

    Value to use when a negative infinity error occurs. Caused by `sinh()` and `tan()`.
    
Domain Error Value:
    #channels: /domval

    Value to use when the input is out of the legal range of the function. Caused by `asin()`, `acos()`, `log10()`, `logN()`, `ln()` and `sqrt()`.
    
Divide Error Value:
    #channels: /divval

    Value to use when a divide by zero error occurs. Caused by `pow(x,y)`.
