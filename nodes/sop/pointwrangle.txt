"""Runs a VEX snippet to modify point attributes, including position."""

== Overview ==

This is a very powerful, low-level node that lets experts who are
familiar with VEX tweak point attributes using code.

This node corresponds to the [VOP SOP|Node:sop/vopsop],
but uses a textual VEX snippet instead of a VOP network.

WARNING:
    This node requires that you understand the [vex language|/vex/].
    It is very easy to write incorrect code using this node.

This node _runs the snippet on every point_ in the input geometry.
The snippet can edit the input geometry by changing attributes.
It can access information from other geometry using attributes and VEX functions.

* Press ((MMB)) on the node to see any error output from the snippet.

* You can use the VEX function `ch` to evaluate parameters.
  The path is relative to this node (`ch("parm")` will evaluate the parameter `parm` on this node).
  This evaluation will be done at the current time.

* Unlike the [Point SOP|Node:sop/point], this does not use local variables.
  Further, all backtick expressions and `$F` variables will be evaluated at frame 1,
  not the current time.
  Use `Frame`, `Time`, or `TimeInc` instead.

== Context ==

This node runs the VEX snippet in the *SOP context*.

== VEX variables ==

You can create temporary VEX variables.
Normal VEX variables do not have a `@` prefix.
For example, the following code swaps `P` and `Cd`.

{{{
#!vex
vector temp = @P;
@P = @Cd;
@Cd = temp;
}}}

== Global Variables ==

The VEX `sop` context provides several global variables you can access,
such as `P`, that correspond to attributes.
While you can access these directly, we recommend you use the `@` prefix
for clarity.

The following global variables do not correspond to attributes
and may be useful in snippets.

`Npt`:
    Total number of points.
`Time`:
    Current time in seconds.
`Frame`:
    Current time in frames.
`TimeInc`:
    Time increment between frames, in seconds.
`OpInput1`, `OpInput2`, `OpInput3`, `OpInput4`:
    A string that can be used to refer to the corresponding input
    of this SOP in vex operations that take file parameters.

@parameters

Point group:
    A subset of points in the input geometry to run the program on.
    Leave this blank to affect all points in the input.

VEXpression:
    #id: snippet

    A snippet of VEX code that will manipulate the point attributes.
    You can use `@<<variable_name>>` syntax to access geometry attributes.

Attributes to Create:
    #id: exportlist

    Only create attributes if their names match this pattern.
    The default pattern allows any attribute to be created.
    
    You can restrict the created attributes by replacing the `*` with a list of allowed names.
    Global attributes, such as `Cd`, `v`, and `id`, will be created even if they are not in this list.
