= Constant =

"""Create up to forty new channels."""

This chop allows you to create up to forty new channels. Each channel
can be named and assigned a different value. To create a channel, enter
a channel name in any left parameter in the 0, 10, 20 or 30 pages, then
adjust the value to its right.

The interval is one sample by default (at index 0). An interval range
can be optionally set in the __Channel__ tab.

A simple Constant CHOP with no inputs is the most common use of the
chop. However, the channels names and values can be set up by connecting
any CHOP to its input and clicking the __Snapshot Input__ button on the __Snap__ tab. This allows you to get some channels from another chop and adjust
them with sliders in the Constant CHOP.

The second input can be used to add offsets to the constant values. When
the second input (Active) is greater than zero, any change to the first
input will be added to the output of the CHOP. This is useful for
adjusting Constant CHOP values from external input devices like a midi
slider box. For example you can connect the mouse or a midi slider box
to a Mouse or midi In CHOPs, and you can raise/lower the Constant CHOP
values by holding the Active input on, while moving the mouse or
sliders.


@parameters

    == 0-9 ==

        Channel 0-9:
            #channels: /value0-9

            User-defined channels 0 to 9.

    == 10-19 ==

        Channel 10-19:
            #channels: /value10-19

            User-defined channels 10 to 19.

    == 20-29 ==

        Channel 20-29:
            #channels: /value20-29

            User-defined channels 20 to 29.

    == 10-19 ==

        Channel 30-39:
            #channels: /value30-39

            User-defined channels 30 to 39.

    == Snap ==

        Snapshot Input:
            Click this button to capture the input channels' values at
            the current frame.
        First Channel:
            #channels: /first

            Specify the starting channel index to snap from.
        Active Needs Current:
            When on, the second input, the Active input only has an
            effect if this CHOP is the current CHOP. When off, it
            doesn't matter if this is the current CHOP. Used by the
            Animation Editor when editing keyframes.

    == Channel ==

        Single Frame:
            Only create one-sample channels, at the Start position.
        Start:
            #channels: /start

            The start position of the CHOP.
        End:
            #channels: /end

            The end position of the CHOP.
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample rate of the CHOP.
        Extend Left:
            The left extend condition (before the CHOP's start).
        Extend Right:
            The right extend condition (after the CHOP's end).
        Default Value:
            #channels: /defval

            The value to use for the "Default Value" extend condition
            type.
