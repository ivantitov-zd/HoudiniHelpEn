"""Computes the gradient of an image."""

Computes the gradient of the image, which indicates the direction of
greatest luminance increase in UV. The map produced looks like a bump
map.

The different maps produced by this operation are:

UV Gradient:
    Computes the UV gradient of the image, which is a 2D
    vector which points in the direction of greatest luminance increase.
    The magnitude of the vector is the increase amount. Similar to the
    results produced by the Bump COP.

Normal Map:
    Computes a normal map from the gradient. The normal and
    the gradient are similar: the normal is a normalized 3D vector with
    the Z component set to 1 and X & Y set to the U & V values of the
    gradient. The normal is then mapped from `[-1,1]` to `[0,1]` to match standard 
    normal map conventions.

Gradient Magnitude:
    Computes the gradient magnitude, which appears
    as a luminance edge-detected image.

Thresholded Magnitude:
    Computes the gradient magnitude and only
    accepts values between the low and high threshold values. If normalize
    is on, the values are mapped from low to high to 0 to 1.

Sum of Neighbor Gradient Magnitudes:
    Compute the gradients between the
    current pixel and its 4 immediate neighbors and sum the magnitudes of each.
    This highlights areas with a high degree of local change.


@parameters

Gradient Type:
    The channel used to compute the gradient. Normal Map can also use
    Displacement to convert XYZ displacements to normals. Displacement
    does not work for the other output modes and luminance will be used
    instead.

Output:
    The type of output produced:

    UV Gradient:
        Computes the UV gradient of the image, which is a 2D vector
        which points in the direction of greatest luminance
        increase. The magnitude of the vector is the increase
        amount. Similar to the results produced by the Bump COP.
    
    Normal Map:
        Computes a normal map from the gradient. The normal and the
        gradient are similar: the normal is a normalized 3D vector
        with the Z component set to 1 and X & Y set to the U & V
        values of the gradient.
    
    Gradient Magnitude:
        Computes the gradient magnitude, which appears as a
        luminance edge-detected image.
    
    Thresholded Magnitude:
        Computes the gradient magnitude and only accepts values
        between the low and high threshold values. If normalize is
        on, the values are mapped from low to high to 0 to 1.
    
    Sum of Neighbor Gradient Magnitudes:
        Compute the gradients between the current pixel and its 4 
        immediate neighbors and sum the magnitudes of each.
        
Low/High Threshold:
    The low and high thresholds for thresholded magnitude output.
    
Normalize:
    If UV Gradient output is used, this normalizes the gradient's
    magnitudes to 1. If Thresholded Magnitude is used, this maps the
    low to high range to 0 - 1.
