"""Creates multiple copies of the input geometry, or copies the geometry
onto the points of the second input."""

The Copy Stamp node has two main functions, with the second function being the
most useful:

* Create multiple copies of the input geometry. You can apply
  transformations progressively to each copy. So, for example, you could
  copy a box model into a line-up of identical boxes descending in
  size.

* Copy the first input (source) geometry onto the points of the second
  input (template) geometry. This is very useful for populating scenes
  with geometry with full control over the placement of the copies.

  For example, you can arrange copies in a spherical shape by copying
  them onto the points of polygonal sphere. Or you could copy a tree
  model onto the points of a Grid, then add turbulence to the grid's
  points to add randomness to the placement of the trees.

  This operator is especially useful for copying geometry onto the
  points output from a  [particle system|/particles]  (that is, a [POP
  network SOP|Node:sop/popnet]). Whereas  [particle
  instancing|/particles/instancing_rendering]  displays the instanced geometry at
  render time (and is more efficient), using the Copy SOP gives you
  "real" geometry in the network that you can further manipulate.

See [copying and instancing|/copy] for more information.

== Instancing point attributes == (instanceattrs)

When you copy or instance geometry onto points, Houdini looks for specific attributes on the destination points to customize each copy/instance. See [instancing point attributes|/copy/instanceattrs].

== Tips ==

* When making multiple copies (not copying onto points), use the NCY
  (number of copies) local variable in an expression to make values
  independent of the number of copies.

  For example, to have the each copy rotated so they go from 0 to
  360 degrees, set the rotation to `360/$NCY`.

* You can create multiple copies around an axis, then skin them to
  create complex lathe-like effects, similar to the results of the
  [Revolve SOP|Node:sop/revolve].

* To alleviate issues when copying to normals, you can add up vectors to template points or do it in POPs with an [Up Vector POP|Node:pop/upvector].

<!--
Also, while not intuitive, the scaling is ALSO dependent on the "Rotate to template normal" toggle being enabled. If the toggle is off, the copied geometry will not change orientation OR scale.
-->

@parameters

Source Group:
    A subset of the source (first input) primitives to copy from.
    You can create groups with the [Group SOP|Node:sop/group].

Template Group:
    A subset of the template (second input) points to copy onto.
    Please note, that only point group specifications are valid for
    this parameter.


== Copy ==

Number of copies:
    #channels: /ncy

    The number of copies of the original geometry.
    
Transform Using Template Point Attributes:
    Rotates copies to face the template point normals. Also
    applies translations, rotations and scales according to the
    trans, rot, and scale point attributes on the template
    points (if these attributes exist).

Transform Cumulative:
    Each copy is transformed relative to the previous.

Transform Order:
    Order transformations occur.

Rotate Order:
    Order rotations occur.

Translate:
    #channels: /tx /ty /tz

    Translation along xyz axes.

Rotate:
    #channels: /rx /ry /rz

    Rotation about xyz axes.

Scale:
    #channels: /sx /sy /sz

    Non-uniform scaling along xyz axes.

Shear:
    Amount of shearing. The three values represent X on XY
    plane, X on XZ plane, and Y on YZ plane respectively.
Pivot:
    #channels: /px /py /pz

    The local pivot point of the copy.

Uniform Scale:
    #channels: /scale

    Uniform scaling.

Preserve Normal Length:
    Normals to maintain length after transformations.

Create Output Groups:
    Places each copy into a primitive group.

Preserve Groups:
    Don't delete the contents of the copy group if it already
    exists before adding the copied primitives.

Copy Groups:
    The name of the group to create for each copy.


== Stamp ==

<!--
    Stamping lets you set up values that vary per-copy on the Copy node, and then refer to those variables in the source network using the [Exp:stamp] function. See [copy stamping|/copy/stamping] for more information.
-->

Stamp Inputs:
    Stamp proceeding variables for each input copied.

Cache Stamping Geometry:
    If enabled, keep local copies of the input geometry for each set of stamp parameter values.  If there are a fixed number of input geometries which are repeated multiple times, it can improve efficiency by avoiding the recooking of the input geometry.  If the input geometry changes every time it's stamped, it can cause increased memory usage during cooking.

Pack Geometry Before Copying:
    Pack the input geometry into an Embedded Packed primitive before copying. This results in the input geometry being shared by each copy rather than being duplicated for each copy.

Pivot Location:
    Specifies how to initialize the offset for the point referenced by the
    packed primitive.

Display As:
    The viewport LOD for the specified packed primitives.

Attribute Stamps:
    Any point attributes on the template geometry that match this
    will also be stamped.  They will be stamped as stamps of the
    same name as the attribute.  Float and integer attributes
    will stamp their first value as a float.  String attributes
    will stamp as strings.

Variable/Value n:
    Token and value of each stamp variable. Changes values of
    parameters which include param function.

== Attribute ==

The parameters on this tab control how attributes on the
template points affect the copies.


Use Template Point Attributes:
    #channels: /doattr

    Copy attributes from the template points onto the copies,
    according to the values in the attribute fields below.

Attribute fields:
    #channels: /setpt /setprim /setvtx /mulpt /mulprim /mulvtx /addpt /addprim /addvtx /subpt /subprim /subvtx

    (Available when __Copy template point attributes__ is on
    above.)

    The _columns_ represent _possible ways of combining the
    attributes_ from template geometry with the attributes from
    the source geometry.

    Set:
        Copy the template attributes onto the copies.
    Mult:
        Multiply the template attributes by the corresponding
        source attributes.
    Add:
        Add the template attributes to the corresponding source
        attributes.
    Sub:
        Subtract the template attributes from the corresponding
        source attributes.
    The _rows_ represent _the different entities you can copy
    attributes onto_: points, primitives, and vertices.

    At the _intersection_ of each column and row, you can enter
    a list/pattern of attributes.

    For example:

    * To copy all attribute values from the template points to
      the primitive attributes of the copies, set the field at
      __Set/To Prim__ to `*`.

    * To multiply primitive colors by the template's colors, set
      the field at __Mult/To Prim__ to `Cd`.

    * To add the texture coordinates of the template to the
      coordinates of the source, set the field at __Add/To
      Point__ to __uv__.

    Copy Local Variables:
        All local variables referring to the manipulated attributes are
        copied.

@inputs

Source:
    The geometry to copy.

Template:
    (Optional) Copy the source geometry onto the points of this
    geometry.

@locals

CY:
    The number of the copy currently being generated. Starts at 0.
NCY:
    The total number of copies that will be created (the value of
    the __Number of copies__ parameter).
PT:
    The point number of the Template being copied onto. If there is
    a template group, this will be the index into the group, _not_
    the actual point number. Use `TPT` to always get the actual
    point number.

    The total number of points in the template geometry.

    point, independent of any template groups. See `PT` above.

    number is between 0 (when born) and 1 (when about to die).
