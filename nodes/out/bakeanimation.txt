"""Bakes animation from object transforms and CHOP overrides."""

== Overview ==

This node bakes animation from a list of objects onto another list of objects.

It can be used to transfer local parameter animation in the same way you would 
copy channels using Copy/Paste Expressions/Channels in the Parameter Editor.

It also supports baking object transforms in world space, and baking the results of object constraints to keyframes. When baking, new keyframes is added based on the `Sample Rate`. At a rate of 24, 24 keys will be added per second. Try keeping it to the same value as your scene `$FPS`.

The `Source Objects` node list defines which object nodes to read the animation from.
The `Target Objects` node list defines which object nodes to write the animation to.
The order of `Source Objects` and `Target Objects` is important, since it defines the relationship between each source and target objects pairs.
You can also use patterns to build your lists.

For example, you can get all the rig controls out of the [Simple Female|Node:obj/simplefemale] rig by using: `/obj/simplefemale1/ctrl_%`.

The `Parameters` filter string defines which parameters will be copied and which parameters the transform baking will write to. It matches the source parameter names. It supports pattern matching strings such as `t[xyz] r[xyz] s[xyz]`, which expands to `tx ty tz rx ry rz sx sy sz`.

@parameters

Frame Range:
    Allows specification of a range of frames to render.

Start/End/Inc:
    Specifies the first and last frames and the increment. Note that
    when rendering a sequence of images with a fraction Inc, `$N` is
    the number of the frame rendered, $F is the nearest integer
    frame number, `$FF` is the floating point frame number.

Sample Rate:
    The sample rate used when baking keyframes.

Source Objects:
    The list of object nodes to read the animation from.
    When baking a rig, you need to select the controllers inside of the HDA.

Target Objects:
    The list of object nodes to write the animation to.
    This can be the same as the `Source Objects` if you want to bake the animation from constraints or CHOP overrides.

Parameters:
    Defines which parameters will be copied and which parameters the transform baking will write to. It matches the source parameter names.It supports pattern matching strings such as `t[xyz] r[xyz] s[xyz]`, which expands to `tx ty tz rx ry rz sx sy sz`. You could want to also list the `scale` `p[xyz]` and `pr[xyz]` if you want to transfer the uniform scale, pivot and pivot rotate parameters.

Copy Animation from Parameters:
    Copy the all the animation and parameter values from the source parameters to the target parameters. This runs first before the baking process takes place.
    It is important to note that the copy operation follows channels references and will bake the result on the top level HDA.

Copy World Transforms:
    Copy the World Transforms from the source objects to the target objects.
    It ignores objects that have constraints applied.

Copy Constraints Transforms:
    Copy the World Transforms from the source objects to the target objects if
    objects have constraints applied.

Hierarchical Copy Order:
    When baking transforms onto a different hierarchy it is important to bake the parent objects first and to follow the hierarchy. This sorts the list of source and targets based on the target hierarchy.

Log:
    A multi-line string that is filled with all the log messages during the baking.
    This can be useful for debugging the baking process.
