"""Class representing a Houdini desktop (a pane layout)."""

A desktop contains one or more panes.  Each pane contains one or more pane
tabs of various types (scene viewer, parameters, network editor, etc.)  The
main desktop window can be split horizontally or vertically into two panes,
and each pane can itself be split horizontally or vertically.

Note that a floating panel also contains one or more panes and a floating panel
may optionally be attached to a desktop.

The methods in this class that return pane tabs, panes, and floating panels
only return those objects that are attached to (i.e. saved with) the desktop.
To access all the visible pane tabs, panes, and floating panels, including
those not attached to any desktop, use the functions in [Hom:hou.ui].

See also [Hom:hou.ui#curDesktop], [Hom:hou#ui.desktops], [Hom:hou.Pane],
[Hom:hou.PaneTab], and [Hom:hou.FloatingPanel].

@methods

::`name(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::name
    #replaces: Cmd:desk
    Return the desktop's name.

    Each desktop has a unique  name. The desktop's name cannot
    be changed through either the scripting interface or through Houdini.

::`setAsCurrent(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::setAsCurrent
    #replaces: Cmd:desk
    Make this desktop the currently selected one.  See also
    [Hom:hou.ui#desktops].

    This example changes to the animate desktop:
    {{{
    #!python
    desktops_dict = dict((d.name(), d) for d in hou.ui.desktops())
    desktops_dict['Animate'].setAsCurrent()
    }}}

::`panes(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Pane]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::panes
    #replaces: Cmd:pane
    Return the panes inside this desktop.  Note that the result includes panes
    in floating panels as long as they are attached to the desktop.

    The following function will return all visible panes, regardless of
    whether or not they are attached to a desktop:
    {{{
    #!python
    def allPanes():
	'''Return a tuple of all visible panes, regardless of whether or not
	   they are attached to a desktop.'''
	# Loop through all the pane tabs and add each tab's pane to the result
	# if it's not already there.  Note that the only way to uniquely
	# identify a pane is using its id.
	ids_to_panes = {}
	for pane_tab in hou.ui.paneTabs():
	    pane = pane_tab.pane()
	    if pane.id() not in ids_to_panes:
		ids_to_panes[pane.id()] = pane
	return ids_to_panes.values()
    }}}

::`floatingPanels(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.FloatingPanel]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::floatingPanels
    Return all the floating panels attached to this desktop.

    Use [Hom:hou.ui#floatingPanels] to get all the visible floating panels,
    including those not attached to this desktop.

    See also [Hom:hou.Desktop#floatingPaneTabs].

::`paneTabs(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.PaneTab]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::paneTabs
    #replaces: Cmd:pane
    Return the pane tabs that are contained in this desktop or are in floating
    panels attached to this desktop.
    
    This method does not return floating pane tabs that are not attached to
    this desktop.  Use [Hom:hou.ui#paneTabs] to get all the visible pane tabs,
    regardless of whether they are attached to this desktop.

::`currentPaneTabs(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.PaneTab]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::currentPaneTabs
    #replaces: Cmd:pane
    Return the pane tabs that are contained in this desktop or are in floating
    panels attached to this desktop and are currently selected in their
    containing panes.
    
    This method does not return floating pane tabs that are not attached to
    this desktop.  Use [Hom:hou.ui#currentPaneTabs] to get all the selected pane tabs,
    regardless of whether they are attached to this desktop.

::`floatingPaneTabs(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.PaneTab]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::floatingPaneTabs
    Return all the pane tabs in floating panels that are attached to this
    desktop.

::`paneTabOfType(self, type, index=0)` -> [Hom:hou.PaneTab] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::paneTabOfType
    Find and return the pane tab with the desired type.  If no such tab
    exists, return None.  Like [Hom:hou.Desktop#paneTabs], this method
    searches pane tabs in the desktop or in floating panels attached to the
    desktop.

    Use [Hom:hou.ui#paneTabOfType] to search all the visible pane tabs,
    regardless of whether they are attached to this desktop.

    type:
	A [Hom:hou.paneTabType] enumerated variable.

    index:
	If there are multiple tabs with the desired type, this parameter
	determines which one is returned.  Use `index=0` to return the first
	found tab, `index=1` to return the second found tab, etc.  By default,
	index is 0.

    This method can be approximately implemented as follows:
    {{{
    #!python
    def paneTabOfType(self, tab_type, index=0):
	pane_tabs = [t for t in self.paneTabs() if t.type() == tab_type]

	if max(index, 0) > len(pane_tabs):
	    return None
	return pane_tabs[max(index, 0)]
    }}}

::`findPaneTab(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.PaneTab] or None:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::findPaneTab
    Return the pane tab with the given name, or `None` if no such tab exists.
    Like [Hom:hou.Desktop#paneTabs], this method searches pane tabs in the
    desktop or in floating panels attached to the desktop.

    The name may optionally be prefixed by the desktop name and a period.

    Use [Hom:hou.ui#findPaneTab] to search all the visible pane tabs,
    regardless of whether they are attached to this desktop.

::`sceneViewers(self)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.SceneViewer]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::sceneViewers
    #replaces: Cmd:viewls
    #status: ni

::`createFloatingPaneTab(self, pane_tab_type, position=(), size=(), python_panel_interface=None)` -> [Hom:hou.PaneTab]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::createFloatingPaneTab
    #replaces: Cmd:pane
    Create and return a new floating window containing a single pane tab.  Note
    that this method creates a floating panel with a single pane tab, and the
    graphical interface to add more tabs or split the pane inside the panel
    is not exposed.

    pane_tab_type:
	A [Hom:hou.paneTabType] enumerated variable.

    position:
        A tuple of two floats specifying the X and Y positions of the new
        window, respectively.  The window will open near this position,
        not necessarily exactly at this position.  If this value is an empty
	tuple, Houdini will choose a default location.

    size:
	A tuple of two floats specifying the width and height of the new
	window, respectively.  If this value is an empty tuple, Houdini will
	choose a default size.

    python_panel_interface:
	The name of the Python Panel interface to be displayed in the floating
	pane tab.  Specifying the interface name additionally hides the Python
	Panel toolbar.  If `python_panel_interface` is None or points to an
	interface that does not exist then the default Python Panel pane tab is
	displayed along with the toolbar.
	
	This argument is ignored if `pane_tab_type` is not set to
	[Hom:hou.paneTabType#PythonPanel].

    Also note that the floating panel containing the new pane tab does not
    contain any panes: calling [Hom:hou.PaneTab#pane] on the pane tab returns
    None, and calling [Hom:hou.FloatingPanel#panes] on its floating panel
    returns an empty tuple.  See [Hom:hou.FloatingPanel] for more information
    on these stripped down floating panels.

    See also [Hom:hou.Desktop#createFloatingPanel].

    The following example function takes a [Hom:hou.Node] and opens a floating
    parameter pane pinned to that node.
    {{{
    #!python
    def openParmPane(node):
	'''Open a floating parameter pane for a particular node.'''
	pane_tab = hou.ui.curDesktop().createFloatingPaneTab(hou.paneTabType.Parm)
	pane_tab.setCurrentNode(node)
	pane_tab.setPin(True)
	return pane_tab
    }}}

::`createFloatingPanel(self, pane_tab_type, position=(), size=(), python_panel_interface=None)` -> [Hom:hou.FloatingPanel]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::createFloatingPanel
    Create a floating panel and return it.  The returned floating panel
    contains one pane which contains one pane tab of the desired type.

    See [Hom:hou.Desktop#createFloatingPaneTab] for a description of the
    parameters.  This method differs from createFloatingPaneTab in two ways:
    First, it returns the floating panel instead of the pane tab.  Second,
    the floating panel that is created from this method is not locked down,
    and the user can add more pane tabs and split the panes.

    The following example creates a floating panel with a parameters pane tab
    and a channel viewer (motion viewer) pane tab:
    {{{
    #!python
    panel = hou.ui.curDesktop().createFloatingPanel(hou.paneTabType.Parm)
    pane1 = panel.panes()[0]
    pane2 = pane1.splitVertically()
    pane2.tabs()[0].setType(hou.paneTabType.ChannelViewer)
    }}}

::`shelfDock(self)` -> [Hom:hou.ShelfDock]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::shelfDock
    Return the shelf dock for the current desktop.

::`displayHelp(self, node_type)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::displayHelp

    Loads the help for the specified node type in the last opened help browser
    pane tab.  Creates a help browser pane tab if no such pane tab already
    exists.

::`displayHelpPath(self, help_path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::displayHelpPath
    Loads the help for the specified help path in the last opened help browser
    pane tab.  Creates a help browser pane tab if no such pane tab already
    exists.  The path can either be a Houdini help URL (i.e. op:Sop/copy,
    tool:curve) or a raw help path (i.e.  /nodes/sop/copy, shelf/curve).

::`displayHelpPyPanel(self, interface_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::displayHelpPyPanel
    
    Loads the help for the python panel with the specified name in the last
    opened help browser pane tab.  Creates a help browser pane tab if no such
    pane tab already exists.

    Raises HOM_Error if the interface name is invalid.

::`displaySideHelp(self, show=True)` -> [Hom:hou.PaneTab]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::displaySideHelp
    Show or hide the side help pane.

    If show is set to True (default) this method displays the help pane and
    returns a help browser pane tab.  If set to False then this method hides
    the help browser pane at the side of the desktop and returns None.

::`homePage(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::homePage
    #replaces: Cmd:helpbrowser
    #status: ni

::`setHomePage(self, home_page)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::setHomePage
    #replaces: Cmd:helpbrowser
    #status: ni

::`paneTabLinkNumbers(self)` -> tuple of numbers / `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::paneLinkNumbers
    #status: ni

::`panesTabInLinkNumber(self, number)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Pane]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::panesInLinkNumber
    #status: ni

::`pathBasedPaneTabLinkNumbers(self)` -> tuple of numbers / `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::pathBasedPaneLinkNumbers
    #replaces: Cmd:panepath
    #status: ni

::`pathBasedPanesTabInLinkNumber(self, number)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.Pane]:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::pathBasedPanesInLinkNumber
    #status: ni

::`setPathForAllPaneTabs(self, path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::setPathForAllPanes
    #replaces: Cmd:panepath
    #status: ni

::`paneUnderCursor(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::paneUnderCursor
    Return the [Hom:hou.Pane] object located under the mouse cursor.  Return
    `None` if no pane is located under the mouse cursor.

::`paneTabUnderCursor(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Desktop::paneTabUnderCursor
    Similar to [Hom:hou.Desktop#paneUnderCursor] but return the
    [Hom:hou.PaneTab] object instead located under the mouse cursor.  Return
    `None` if no pane tab is located under the mouse cursor.
