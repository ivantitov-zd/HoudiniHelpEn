== Quick start ==

=== Page structure ===
#display: pull left

{{{
= Title =

#name: value

"""Sumary."""

== First heading ==

This is a paragraph.

Separate paragraphs with a blank line.

== Second heading ==

* Bullet one.

* Bullet two

    Sub-paragraph of bullet two.
}}}


=== Styles ===
#display: pull left

{{{
This is *bold*, this is _italics_, this is `code`, 
}}}


=== Comments ===
#display: pull left

{{{
// Single line comment

<!--
HTML-style freeform comment
-->
}}}


== Title ==

=== Title ===
#display: pull left

{{{
= Title =
}}}


=== Pre and subtitles ===
#display: pull left

Titles can have "pre-title" and/or "sub-title" parts that are visually de-emphasized in the HTML.

:box: Title with pre-title
    {{{
    = What's new |> Rendering =
    }}}

:box: Title with sub-title
    {{{
    = Saturday the 14th <| the sequel =
    }}}

:box: Both pre-title and sub-title
    {{{
    = Pre-title |> Main title <| Sub-title =
    }}}


== Properties ==

=== Markup ===
#display: pull left

Properties are used extensively to modify the rendering of blocks. The basic form of a property is:

{{{
#name: value
}}}


=== Page properties ===
#display: pull left

Properties that come before any headings apply to the whole page.

{{{
= Title =

#context: sop
#internal: copy
}}}

See the [list of page properties|#pageprops] below.


=== Block properties ===
#display: pull left

Properties indented under a block apply to that block.

{{{
* This is a bullet point.
    #name: value
}}}

See individual block types below for lists of the available properties for each one.


=== Multi-line ===
#display: pull left

You can have multi-line values by indenting the value.

{{{
#name:
    This is a multi-line
    property value.
}}}


== List of page properties == (pageprops)

Name ||
    #width: 33%
    Value ||
`#icon: <<path>>` |
    Path to a small image to represent this page.
    
`#display:` |
    A space-separated list of display classes to apply to the page.

    `notitle`:
        Don't show the page title.
    
    See [display property|#displayprop] for more. This feature is experimental and subject to change.

`#redirect: <<path>>` |
    When the help system goes to load this page, redirect it to the given path.

`#parent: <<path>>` |
    See [parents and subtopics|#parents].


== Headings ==

=== Markup ===
#display: pull left

{{{
== Heading level 2 ==

=== Heading level 3 ===

==== Heading level 4 ===
}}}


=== ID ===
#display: pull left

You can give a heading an ID using a standard property:

{{{
== How to ==
#id: howto
}}}

This allows you to link to the heading (see linking below). There is also a slightly more compact markup available for associating an ID with a heading:

{{{
== How to == (howto)
}}}


=== Indentation ===
#display: pull left

Usually in this wiki markup, indentation indicates that indented blocks are "inside" the blocks they're indented under. However, it's *not necessary to indent under headings*. The parser will automatically "do the right thing" and add any blocks --- and any subordinate headings --- after a heading to that heading.

For example:

{{{
== Foo ==

This paragraph will be considered part
of the "Foo" section, even though it's not
indented under it.

=== Bar ===

This block is under the "Bar" heading, which
is under the "Foo" heading.
}}}

You only need to indent under a heading if you want some following paragraphs to be under the heading, but not all. This sometimes comes up when including content:

{{{
== Heading to include == (includeme)

    I want this paragraph to be included with the heading when I include it from another page.

I don't want this paragraph to be included.
}}}


=== Display properties ===
#display: pull left

`pull left`:
    Indent the content and show the heading in the left margin.

`notitle`:
    Don't show the heading.


== Lists ==

=== Bullet lists ===
#display: pull left

{{{
* Bullet
* Bullet
}}}


=== Numbered lists ===
#display: pull left

{{{
# First
# Second
}}}


=== Definitions ===
#display: pull left

{{{
Cat:
    A type of animal.

Cinq:
    French word for five.
}}}


=== Tasks ===
#display: pull left

{{{
:task: Start a render:
    # Go to the Render view tab.
    # Click __Render__.

:task: Quit using Houdini:
    Rethink your life choices.
}}}

#display: pull left

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    TIP:

        This is the second paragraph of the tip

    NOTE:
        This is a note.

    WARNING:

    }}}

:tab: Rendering
    TIP:

        This is the second paragraph of the tip.
    
    NOTE:
        This is a note.
    
    WARNING:
        This is something you shouldn't do.

The capitalized `TIP:` syntax is meant to be visually noticeable for writers in a page of markup. It is equivalent to the following more standard markup:

:box: Standard item forms
    {{{
    :tip:
        This is a tip

    :note:
        This is a note.

    :warning:
        This is a warning.
    }}}


=== Other notices ===
#display: pull left

Houdini includes a few other types of notices. You can only use the standard item markup for these, they don't have captialized equivalents.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    :new:
        Something new.

    :improved:
        Something got faster.

    :changed:
        Something changed.

=== Font Awesome ===
#display: pull left

You can also icons from the [Font Awesome|http://https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/] icon font in your pages.

Headings, bullets, definitions, notices, table cells, and tabs can have custom glyphs using the `#glyph:` property.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    * Remember to bring a brolly.
        #glyph: fa-umbrella
    
    * Go to the office.
        #glyph: fa-building
    
    * Pick up empty boxes.
        #glyph: fa-cube
        
    TIP:
        #glyph: fa-certificate
        
        This is a new feature.
    }}}

:tab: Rendering
    * Remember to bring a brolly.
        #glyph: fa-umbrella
    
    * Go to the office.
        #glyph: fa-building

    TIP:
        #glyph: fa-certificate
        
        This is a new feature.

You can embed a Font Awesome glyph in text:

Markup ||
    Rendering ||

`+(fa-rocket)` |
    +(fa-rocket)

You can use other font-awesome CSS classes in the `#glyph` property, such as `fa-spin`.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    * This will take a few seconds.
        #glyph: fa-spinner fa-spin
    }}}

== Tables ==

=== Simple tables ===
#display: pull left

The simple table markup handles most cases.

Lines that end in a double vertical line (`||`) are _heading_ cells. Lines that end in a single vertical line (`|`) are regular cells. Indented cells appear _next to_ the parent.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    Column 1 ||
        Column 2 || 
    
    First cell |
        Second cell
        
        Second paragraph in second cell.
    }}}

:tab: Rendering
    Column 1 ||
        Column 2 ||
    
    First cell |
        Second cell
        
        Second paragraph in second cell.

The main drawback of the simple markup is that only the last cell in a row can have multiple paragraphs.


=== Full tables ===
#display: pull left

If you need a more complex table than what the simple markup can create (for example, row or columns spans), you can use an HTML table. See [HTML|#html] below.


== HTML == (html)

=== Embedding HTML ===
#display: pull left

You can embed HTML in wiki markup. With the HTML tags, text is parsed as wiki text.

{{{
You need to <strike>burn</strike> deprecate that node.
}}}


=== Pseudo HTML ===
#display: pull left

For complex HTML, it can be cleaner to use a "pseudo-HTML" markup based on indentation.

Lines ending with `>>` are treated as an HTML element tag, with any content indented under it treated as the HTML element content. 

{{{
table width="100%">>
    tr>>
        td colspan="2">>
            Alpha
        td>>
            Bravo
    tr>>
        td>> Charlie
        td>> Delta
        td>> Echo
}}}


== Organization ==

=== Dividers ===
#display: pull left

A line with three or more tilde (`~`) characters creates a horizontal line. If you put text after the tildes it creates a labeled divider.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    Line divider

    ~~~

    Line divider with text

    ~~~ Or ~~~
    
    Line with display style
    
    ~~~~
        #display: red
    
    Easy!
    }}}

:tab: Markup
    Line divider

    ~~~

    Line divider with text

    ~~~ OR ~~~
    
    Line with display style
    
    ~~~~
        #display: red
    
    Easy!


=== Boxes ===
#display: pull left

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    :box:
        #display: raised

        This is content inside a box.
    }}}

:tab: Rendering
    :box:
        #display: raised

        This is content inside a box.

:col:
    :box:
        #display: rounded

        `rounded`

    :box:
        #display: raised

        `raised`

:col:
    :box:
        #display: bordered
        
        `bordered`
    
    :box:
        #display: inverted
        
        `inverted`


=== Captions ===
#display: pull left

Adding text to a `box` block puts a small label on the content inside.

:tab: Markup
    <pre>
:box: Decorator example
    {{{
    #!python
    @decorator
    def foo():
        return "bar"
    }}}</pre>

:tab: Rendering
    :box: Decorator example
        {{{
        #!python
        @decorator
        def foo():
            return "bar"
        }}}


=== Columns ===
#display: pull left

Columns adapt to the browser width. They will collapse into a single column when their container is narrow.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    :col:
        Column 1 paragraph 1

        Column 1 paragraph 2

    :col:
        Column 2 paragraph 1

        Column 2 paragraph 2
    }}}

:tab: Rendering
    :col:
        Column 1 paragraph 1

        Column 1 paragraph 2

    :col:
        Column 2 paragraph 1

        Column 2 paragraph 2
    
    (If you don't see columns above, try widening your browser window.)


=== Tabs ===
#display: pull left

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    :tab: Reality
        This is the real world.

    :tab: Fantasy
        This is the imaginary world.
    }}}
    
:tab: Rendering
    :tab: Reality
        This is the real world.

    :tab: Fantasy
        This is the imaginary world.

`#selected: true`:
    Add this property to a tab to make it selected when the page loads.

`#glyph: <<font-awesome-name>>`:
    Add this property to display a Font Awesome glyph in a tab.


=== Dividing blocks ===
#display: pull left

If you use only two tildes (`~~`) it creates an "invisible" divider. This doesn't render as a line, but breaks up groups of blocks of the same type. This is useful for when you have a series of `:tab:` or `:col:` blocks and you want to separate them into different groups.

:caption: Four adjacent `:col:` blocks become a four column layout
    {{{
    :col:
        Far left
    :col:
        Middle left
    :col:
        Middle right
    :col:
        Far right
    }}}

:caption: Invisible divider `~~` separates adjacent blocks into two groups
    {{{
    :col:
        Left
    :col:
        Right
    
    ~~
    
    :col:
        Left
    :col:
        Right
    }}}


=== Bubbles !!(beta) ===
#display: pull left

A bubble is a special box type that looks like a chat bubble.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    :bubble: He said _what_!?
        #dir: left
        #display: yellow

    :bubble:
        #dir: right
        #display: teal

        I know right!?

        Where does he get the nerve?
    }}}

:tab: Rendering
    :bubble: He said _what_!?
        #dir: left
        #display: yellow

    :bubble:
        #dir: right
        #display: teal

        I know right!?

        Where does he get the nerve?

`#dir: <<direction>>`:
    :col:
        :bubble: `right`
            #dir: right
    :col:    
        :bubble: `down`
            #dir: down
    :col:
        :bubble: `left`
            #dir: left
    :col:
        :bubble: `up`
            #dir: up
    
`#display: <<look>>`:
    Use to set the color of the bubble. See [display properties|#display-beta].


=== Footnotes !!(beta) ===
#display: pull left

You can hide extra text in a "footnote" called a _fold_. The `[Fold:<<name>>]` shortcut creates a button. If there is a `:box:` with a property `#fold: <<name>>` with the same name, clicking the button will reveal the box content.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    Everything you wanted to know about Houdini[Fold:1].
    
    :box:
        #fold: 1
        
        ...but were afraid to ask
    }}}

:tab: Rendered
    Everything you wanted to know about Houdini[Fold:1].
    
    :box:
        #fold: 1
        
        ...but were afraid to ask

You can refer to the same fold box using multiple shortcuts, as long as they have the same name as the box's `#fold:` property.


=== Billboard !!(beta) ===
#display: pull left

A large "cover" image with text over top, used to create a "splash" for introductory or table-of-contents pages.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    :billboard:Houdini 15.0
        #image: /images/billboards/zombie_flame_poster.jpg

        Procedural animation and effects
    }}}

:tab: Rendering
    :billboard:Houdini 15.0
        #image: /images/billboards/zombie_flame_poster.jpg

        Procedural animation and effects


== Code ==

=== Inline ===
#display: pull left

Put text within backticks (<code>`</code>) to render it as code.

{{{
Type `echo $HFS` in a shell.
}}}


=== Code blocks ===
#display: pull left

Lines between `{{{` and `}}}` are treated as a block of code.

If the first line starts with `#!` it specifies the syntax coloring to use. You can use any syntax names from the [Pygments|http://pygments.org] library, as well as Houdini-specific languages `hscript` and `vex`.

<pre>
{{{
#!python
def double(n):
    return n * 2
}}}
</pre>


== Display property == (displayprop)

=== #display: !!(beta) ===
#display: pull left

You can use a `#display:` property on the page and on various block types to modify how the block appears in HTML. The value is a space-separated list of class

{{{
== Header ==
#display: notitle collapsible inverted

:tab: Tab 1
    #display: red
    
    Tab content.
}}}

NOTE:
    Many possible display values don't work on all block types, or aren't fully implemented, or may not work in all combinations.

The following block types accept display properties in various forms:

:col:
    * Page
    * Headings
    * Columns
    * Table cells
:col:
    * Tabs
    * Dividing lines
    * Boxes
    * Bubbles


=== Values ===
#display: pull left

`notitle`:
    For a page or heading, hides the title.

`collapsible`:
    For a heading, allows the user to collapse and expand the content.

`collapsed`:
    For a heading, start in a collapsed state.

`pull <<left|right>>`:
    For a heading, moves the title beside the body.

`inverted`:
    Display the content as light-on-dark.

`<<colorname>>`:
    You can use the name of a color to colorize the block. Different block types may apply colors in different ways.

    :tab: Markup
        {{{
        :box:
            #display: raised yellow

== @-sign sections ==

=== Overview ===
#display: pull left

An @-section acts like a top-level heading. It marks a particular section of a page. Items within that section may be treated specially.

For example, node help will have a "parameters" section:

{{{
@parameters
}}}

Within that section, anonymous items are treated as documenting a specific parameter:

{{{
@parameters

::Group:
    Specifies which elements this node applies to.
}}}

This will be indexed and rendered differently than if you used an anonymous item block outside the `@parameters` section


=== Markup ===
#display: pull left

An @-section looks like this:

{{{
@name Title
}}}

If you don't give a title, the heading will render using the name of the section capitalized (for example `@parameters` -> Parameters).


=== Properties ===
#display: pull left

`#status: <<code>>`:
    - `nd` -- not documented
    - `ni` -- not implemented.

You can use `#display:` properties on sections just like headings.


== Includes ==

=== Markup ===
#display: pull left

To include the content of another file (the path can be absolute or relative to the current page):

{{{
[Include:path/to/file]
}}}

To include only one block from another file, add a `#` and the ID of the block:

{{{
[Include:/path/to/file#blockid]
}}}

To include only the *contents* of one block from another file, add a trailing slash after the ID:

{{{
[Include:/path/to/file#blockid/]
}}}


== Searches == (searches)

=== Basics ===
#display: pull left

The `:list:` block lets you show the results of search queries on the page.

:tab: Markup
    {{{
    :list:
        #query: title:cap
    }}}

:tab: Rendering
    :list:
        #query: title:cap
        #display: show-icons


=== Properties ===
#display: pull left

`#query: <<search query>>`:
    A search query.

`#filtered: <<yes|no>>`:
    If `no`, don't show a filtering interface above the results.

`#filters: <<field names>>`:
    A space separated list of search fields to allow the user to filter the results by.

`#sortedby: <<field name>>`:
    The name of a field to sort the results by. Prefix the field name with a minus sign (`-`) to reverse the sorting order.

`#groupedby: <<field name>>`:
    Group the results by the value of the given field.

    If you specify a `#groupedby:` field, you can also optionally specify a `#labels: <<path>>` property. This points to an `.ini` file on the server with a `[Labels]` section that maps field values to group labels.
    
`#includecontent: <<true|false>>`:
    If `true`, includes the content of each matched document under the link. This can make your page _very_ large, so be careful.

`#limit: <<num>>`:
    Limit the search results to this number of hits.

`#display:`:
    `show-icons`:
        Displays icons for the search results that have them.

    `narrow-columns` / `columns` / `wide-columns`:
        Divides the results into columns.


== Parents and subtopics == (parents)

=== Index page ===
#display: pull left

In a directory of wiki files, any file named `index.txt` is treated as the "table of contents" page for the directory. If the user browses to the directory, the server shows the `index` page.


=== Subtopics ===
#display: pull left

To link to "child" topics of the current "parent" page, create a `@subtopics` section.

{{{
@subtopics

::[Introduction to rendering|intro]
::[Advanced rendering|advanced]
}}}

The "child" links do not need to be in the same directory as the parent.

You can use headings in the subtopics section to organize the links:

{{{
@subtopics

== Getting started ==

::[Introduction to rendering|intro]
::[Starting a basic render|basic]

== Next steps ==

::[Tuning for performance|tuning]
}}}


=== Parent property ===
#display: pull left

Each page displays "breadcrumbs" indicating the parents of the current page in the hierarchy. If the directory a page is in has an `_index` page, that is automatically treated as the parent page.

If the directory doesn't have an `_index` page, or you want to use a different parent, include a top-level `#parent:` property with the path to the parent page:

{{{
= Title =

#parent: /examples/
}}}
