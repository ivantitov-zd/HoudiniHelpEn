= Subdivide =

"""Subdivides polygons into smoother, higher-resolution polygons."""

This node takes an input polygon surface (which can be piped into one or
both inputs), and divides each face to create a smoothed polygon surface
using a Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm. It is similar to the Paste
op in that it divides up all or part of a surface allowing you to
increase areas of local detail (especially useful for avoiding the
angular appearance often associated with polygonal models) without
adding lots of extra geometry to the entire object. While the topology
of the input mesh can be arbitrary, for best results all polygons should
be convex and relatively uniform in distribution.

All polygons in the left input which are specified by the "Group" field
are used to determine the polygon mesh to subdivide. For polygon edges
to be classified as the same edge, they must share the same points.
Merely being physically close is not sufficient.

The elements of the right input specified by the "Creases" field are
used as creases. Each edge in a crease polygon corresponds to the edge
in the polygon mesh which has the same point numbers. Again, point
position is irrelevant.

Vertex attributes are supported and preserved, however, instead of being
properly subdivided they are merely linearly interpolated.

== Using Subdivide ==
                
:task:Subdivide a polygonal surface:
    # Select the faces or edges you want to subdivide.
        
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/subdivide][Subdivide|/nodes/sop/subdivide] tool on the __Polygon__ tab.

    # In the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms], use the __Depth__ parameter to control the level of smoothness.

        Each level recursively subdivides the original control polygons, so you should avoid high levels (above 3) or you will get extremely complex geometry. Add detail where it is needed (see below) rather than increasing the detail of the entire surface.

:task:Add local detail:
    # Select the faces of the subdivision surface you want to further subdivide.
          
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/subdivide][Subdivide|/nodes/sop/subdivide] tool on the __Polygon__ tab.

        You can use this technique to add extra levels of detail to various areas and to various depths.

[Image:/images/shelf/subdivide_before.png] [Image:/images/shelf/subdivide_after.png]

== How to ==

:task:Add local detail:
    # After you create the initial subdivided surface, use the  [tab
      menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to select the [Subdivide
      operator|Node:sop/subdivide] again.

    # Select the faces of the subdivision surface you want to
      further subdivide, then press ((Enter)) to finish the
      selection.

    # You can use this technique to add extra levels of detail to
      various areas and to various depths.

:task:Crease edges interactively:
    # Make sure the polygonal control cage is visible.

    # In the viewer, use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to select the
      [Crease operator|Node:sop/crease].

    # Press ((3)) for edge selection mode.

    # Select the edges you want to crease, then press ((Enter)) to
      finish the selection.

    # In the parameter editor, set the __Operation__ and __Crease__
      parameters.

      This adds the crease attribute to the selected edges. The
      Subdivision node picks up the attribute and uses it to crease
      the surface.

:task:Crease edges by number:
    * Specify faces in the Subdivision node's __Creases__ parameter
      and then set the __Crease weight__ parameter.

WARNING:
    The RenderMan renderer will directly use the Crease attribute
    applied by the Crease Operation, but it will _not_ be used by the
    Mantra renderer due to patent issues.

== Creases ==

Creases control the strength of pull of the polygon faces on the
subdivision surfaces, much like a magnet drawing the surface towards
the reference polygon. They can be applied selectively using the
Creases field to specify an input group to use.

Creases work by controlling the strength of the pull of the polygon
faces on the subdivision surfaces, like a magnet drawing the surface
towards the reference polygon. The figure below shows the result of
setting the _Crease Weight_ to 0, 1, 2 reading from left to right.
As the weight increases so the pull effect strengthens and the shape
approaches the reference polygon.

== Crease Weights and Renderman ==

Crease weight attributes which are added, but not yet Subdivided are
preserved when a rib file is generated. They are then used
internally by RenderMan to implement subdivision surfaces during the
rendering process.

NOTE:
    In order to output the crease weights in the rib file, your geo
    object must have the Render page > Geometry > Polygons as
    Subdivision Surfaces parameter set.

== The Crease Algorithm ==

If there is a second input:

* If the Override button is enabled, each edge defined in the second
  input will have its edge crease weight set to the value of the
  override.

* If the vertex attribute `creaseweight` exists on the second input,
  each matching edge in the input will have its crease weight set to
  the maximum of the vertex attributes for any shared edges.

* If the primitive attribute `creaseweight` exists on the second
  input, each polygon in the second input will set matching edges to
  the appropriate weights.

If there is no second input:

* If an override is specified, the value of the override is used for
  all edges in the sub-divided surface.

* If the vertex attribute `creaseweight` exists, this attribute will
  be used to define the crease weights on the edges of the surface.

* If the primitive attribute `creaseweight` exists, this attribute
  will be used to define the crease weights for the subdivision
  surface.

When defining crease weights on shared edges, the maximum of the
weights of the shared edges is used. For example, if two polygons
share an edge and the primitive attribute is used, the maximum of
the crease weight will be used for the shared edge.

When OpenSubdivision is used for refinement, the following are also considered:

* If the point attribute `cornerweight` exists, this attribute will
  be used to define corner weights on vertices of the surface.

* If the group `subdivide_hole` exists, any polygons in that group will be
  considered holes in the subdivision process.  The polygons will contribute to
  the subdivision, but will not appear in the final surface.

* If a detail attribute `osd_scheme` exists, it will override the subdivision
  algorithm specified on the SOP.  When this attribute specifies Loop
  subdivision, the incoming geometry must be triangulated.

* If a detail attribute `osd_vtxboundaryinterpolation` exists, it will override 
  the value of the __Point Attributes__ parameter.

* If a detail attribute `osd_fvarlinearinterpolation` exists, it will override 
  the value of the __Vertex Attributes__ parameter.

* If a detail attribute `osd_creasingmethod` exists, it will override 
  the value of the __Crease Method__ parameter.

* If a detail attribute `osd_trianglesubdiv` exists, it will override 
  the value of the __Triangle Subdivision__ parameter.

Please see the [OpenSubdiv|http://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/subdivision_surfaces.html#boundary-interpolation-rules] documentation for further details.

== Closing Cracks ==

Cracks can be closed by either Pulling or Stitching, so only one of
these two options can be chosen at a time from the Surrounding Faces
parameter. Bias applies only to Pulling, and is disabled when
Stitching is chosen.

A crack is formed by a single edge on the non-subdivided area and
multiple edges on the subdivided area. The 'Surrounding Faces' menu
determines what will will happen to the single edge on the
non-subdivided area, and in more generally, to the polygon
containing this edge.

If No Edge Division is chosen and cracks are pulled closed, all the
points on the subdivided edges are pulled (i.e. moved) to the
closest points on the non-subdivided edges. Bias is disabled, when
No Edge Division is specified.

If cracks are pulled with the Divide Edges option, the
non-subdivided edge is split into many sections, so that each each
point on the non-subdivided edge now corresponds to a new point on
the subdivided edge. Then, points on the newly divided edge are
joined with the points on the subdivided boundary. A Bias of 1 will
place these joined points along the subdivided boundary. A bias of 0
will place them along the non- subdivided boundary (and values
between 0 and 1 will place them somewhere in between).

Pulling cracks with the Triangulate option will do exactly the same
thing as Divide Edges, except it will also triangulate the
non-subdivided polygon. This is desirable because pulling the
non-subdivided boundary towards the curved subdivided boundary will
likely generate a non-planar polygon, so Triangulate will divide
this polygon into smaller (planar) ones. Pulling cracks with a Bias
of 1 and triangulating usually produces the nicest results.

The Triangulate option is necessary because the Divide op is not
designed to handle (very) non-planar polygons.

The Stitch Cracks Together option, on the other hand, inserts new
polygons (triangles) to close up the cracks. When No Edge Division
is chosen, Many triangles are created, each having one vertex on one
point of the non-subdivided edge.

When Divide Boundary Edges is chosen, the non-subdivided edge is
divided, so there are more points available to be used for
triangles. The resulting triangles are more regularly shaped (not as
long and skinny). The triangulate option will again triangulate the
non-subdivided polygon, although this option is less likely to be
used because this polygon should remain planar during stitching.

== Operation Parameters ==

    Close Holes

    Do Not Close:
        Don't close holes.
        
    Pull Holes Closed:
        Move points on boundary of subdivided area in order to close
        holes formed during the subdivision.
        
    Stitch Holes Together:
        Add polygons (triangles) to close the holes caused by
        subdividing.
        
    == Surrounding Faces ==

        No Edge Division:
            When No Edge Division is chosen, many triangles are created,
            each having one vertex on one point of the non-subdivided
            edge.
            
        Divide Edges:
            Divides edges surrounding the subdivided area when pulling
            or stitching holes by inserting new polygons (triangles) to
            close up the holes.
            
        Triangulate:
            Does exactly the same thing as Divide Edges, except it also
            triangulates the non-subdivided polygon. This is desirable
            because pulling the non-subdivided boundary towards the
            curved subdivided boundary will likely generate a non-planar
            polygon, so Triangulate will divide this polygon into
            smaller (planar) ones. Pulling holes with a Bias of 1 and
            triangulating usually produces the nicest results.
            
    == Bias ==

        Determines which points are moved when pulling hole closed. 0
        means move points on subdivided area to meet boundary. 1 means
        move points on boundary to meet subdivided area.

                Means move points on boundary to meet subdivided area.


Recompute Point Normals:
        Re-evaluates point normals if they exist. If this is not set, the point normals will be interpolated in the same manner as the points.
Smooth Vertex Attributes:
        If on, vertex attributes will be smoothed in the same manner as the point attributes. However, vertex attributes at seams (places where points meet but the vertex attributes differ) will still be linearly interpolated. If off, the vertex attributes will be linearly interpolated. To match the Mantra subdivision rendering, this should be set to off.
Enforce Consistent Topology:
        If __Pull Cracks Closed__ or __Stitch Cracks Together__ is enabled, different topology might be generated depending on boundary edges between the subdivided primitives and their non-subdivided neighbors. Turning on this option will ensure that this behavior will always produce consistent topology by disregarding collinear edges.

Linear Creases:
        If this option is turned on will switch from the standard (RenderMan) style creases to Mantra's linear creases.

Build Polygon Soups:
        Creates polygon soup primitives instead of separate polygon primitives.

Treat All Curves as Independent:
        If you are subdividing polygon curves and this option is enabled, the possibility of sharing points between curves will be ignored. Each polygon will be subdivided as if each vertex has its own point. This is slightly faster, and since the viewport and Mantra make this assumption when rendering polygon curves as subdivision curves,
        the results will be consistent.

Remove Holes:
        Remove faces identified as holes by OpenSubdiv.  This includes any faces identified in the `subdivision_hole` group on the input.

Point Attributes:
        When using OpenSubdiv for refinement, this controls how point attributes (including `P`) will be interpolated on patch boundaries.
Vertex Attributes:
        When using OpenSubdiv for refinement, this determines how vertex attributes (Face-Varying) will be interpolated over patches.
Crease Rule:
	This determines how OpenSubdiv will perform the creasing operations when subdividing.
Triangle Subdivision:
	When OpenSubdiv does Catmull-Clark refinement, this controls the subdivision rules when there are triangles in the cage.
