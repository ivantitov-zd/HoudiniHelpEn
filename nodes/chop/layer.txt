"""Mix weighted layers of keyframed animation from multiple Channel CHOPs to a base Channel CHOP."""

This CHOP performs a weighted sum of channels coming from Channel CHOPs. The [Animation Layer Editor|/character/animlayer] offers an easy way to create Animation Layer setups without having to dive into CHOP networks.

The CHOP setup consists of a Layer CHOP referred to as the __Layer Mixer__, a Channel CHOP referred to as the __Base Layer__, and zero or more Channel CHOPs referred to as __Animation Layers__. The Base Layer contains absolute values for translate, scale, and rotation which is stored in a Channel CHOP. The weight for the base layer should always be set to 1. Then the animation layers contain relative values for translate, scale, and rotations. The relative values are simply added to the base layer values. This makes it possible to have multiple layers of keyframed animation contributing to the same channel. The Active Layer affects which channels the Animation Editor UI displays and also under which layer the new keyframes will go.

For more information, see the [Animation Layer Mixer|/character/animlayer] help.

@parameters

== Layers ==
Active Layer:
    The active layer is used by animation commands to tell on which animation layer
    new keyframes will go. It's an index that matches the order of the inputs.
Layer Name:
    Names of individual layers for display purpose in the Animation Layer Editor.
Layer Weight:
    Weight values normally from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the contribution of each layer.
Layer Mute:
    Sets the layer contribution to 0.0 without having to modify the weight. It's linked
    to a button in a Animation Layer Editor, and it makes it easier to toggle an animation
    layer on and off to see its effect on the animation.
Layer Solo:
    Sets all the other layers contributions to zero to see only the effect of the given
    layer.
