"""Creates a large explosion rising from the selected object."""

Note: the effect created by this tool in Houdini 12+ looks different from the
Fireball preset in prior versions of Houdini.

The resolution (__Divisions__) of the mushroom cloud's pyro box is low to begin with. As you play with the parameters and start to get the motion you want, increase the __Divisions__ to get more detail.

On the [Pyro solver node|Node:dop/pyrosolver]...

* Use the __Smoke amount__ to control the amount of secondary smoke.

* Use the __Heat output__ parameter to make the plume rise faster.

* Use the __Gas released__ parameter to influence the size of the plume.

* Use the __Shredding__ controls to rip the streaks apart.

* Use the __Disturbance__ and __Turbulence__ controls to add detail or
  change motion.

Change the Noise and Scale controls on the
[Fluid Source surface node|Node:sop/fluidsource] to change the emission.
