"""Represents a connection (wire) between two Nodes."""

== Overview ==

You can get a list of `NodeConnection` objects from a [Hom:hou.Node] instance
using [Hom:hou.Node#inputConnections] and [Hom:hou.Node#outputConnections].

NOTE:
    It is probably easier to use the [Hom:hou.Node.#inputs] and
    [Hom:hou.Node#outputs] methods (which return the endpoints of a node's
    connections) to traverse the network, rather than dealing with the
    connections themselves.

This object is "read-only". To create or edit connections, use methods on the node,
such as
[Hom:hou.Node#setNamedInput],
[Hom:hou.Node#setInput],
[Hom:hou.Node#setFirstInput],
[Hom:hou.Node#setNextInput],
[Hom:hou.Node#createInputNode], and
[Hom:hou.Node#createOutputNode].

== Input and Output meaning ==

The [Hom:hou.NodeConnection#outputNode] and [Hom:hou.NodeConnection#inputNode] are named in relation to the _nodes_,
*not* the "input" and "output" ends of the _connector_.

[Image:../images/NodeConnection_ends.png]

So, `outputNode()` returns the node whose _output_ is this connector.
In the diagram, `outputNode()` on the highlighted connection would return
node "A".  `inputNode()` returns the node whose `input` is this connector.
In the diagram, `inputNode()` on the highlighted connection would return
node "C".

== Connection indexes ==

Some nodes have multiple inputs and/or multiple outputs.
For example, most VOPs have several inputs and outputs.
The [Split DOP|Node:dop/split] has multiple outputs.

A node with a multi-input, such as the [Merge SOP|Node:sop/merge],
has multiple "inputs" for each connection, even though in the network editor
it is drawn with one "connection point" at the top.

Inputs and outputs are always addressed by their position (index).

@methods

::`outputNode(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::outputNode
    Return the node on the output side of this connection. This is the node
    that the connection goes to, in the direction of data flow. If this
    connection has a network dot as its output, this method returns None.

::`outputItem(self)` -> [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::outputItem
    Return the node or network dot on the output side of this connection.
    This is the node or dot that the connection goes to, in the direction
    of data flow. This method should never return None.

::`inputNode(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Node]:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::inputNode
    Return the node on the input side of this connection. This is the node
    that the connection comes from, in the direction of data flow. If this
    connection goes through an indirect input, this will return the node
    connected to the parent node (or `None` if nothing is connected).
    
::`outputIndex(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::outputIndex
    Returns the index of the output connection on the node that the input
    side of this connections connects to.  If this connection goes through an
    indirect input, this will return the index of the output connected to the
    parent node (or `0` if nothing is connected).

::`inputIndex(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::inputIndex
    Returns the index of the input connection on the node that the output
    side of this connections connects to.

::`outputName(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::outputName
    Returns the name of the output connection on the node that the input
    side of this connections connects to.

::`outputLabel(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::outputLabel
    Returns the label of the output connection on the node that the input
    side of this connections connects to.

::`outputDataType(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_VopNode::outputDataTypes
    Returns the data type of the output connection on the node that the input
    side of this connections connects to.

    This method only applies to VOP node connections.  Raises
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if invoked on a non VOP node connection.

    The string returned by this method can be used to set the Type parameter
    on a Parameter or Constant VOP.
    
::`inputName(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::inputName
    Returns the name of the input connection on the node that the output
    side of this connections connects to.
    
::`inputLabel(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::inputLabel
    Returns the label of the input connection on the node that the output
    side of this connections connects to.

::`inputDataType(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_VopNode::outputDataTypes
    Returns the data type of the input connection on the node that the output
    side of this connections connects to.

    This method only applies to VOP node connections.  Raises
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if invoked on a non VOP node connection.

    The string returned by this method can be used to set the Type parameter
    on a Parameter or Constant VOP.
    
::`subnetIndirectInput(self)` -> [Hom:hou.SubnetIndirectInput]:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::subnetIndirectInput
    If this connection has a subnet indirect input connected to it instead of
    a node, return the corresponding object.  Otherwise, return `None`.  See
    [Hom:hou.SubnetIndirectInput] for information on subnet indirect inputs.

::`inputItem(self)` -> [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::inputItem
    If this connection has a subnet indirect input connected to it,
    return the corresponding [Hom:hou.SubnetIndirectInput] object.
    If this connection has a node connected to it, return the corresponding
    [Hom:hou.Node] object. Otherwise, return `None`. This method is
    essentially equivalent to the following:

    {{{
    #!python
    def getInputItem(node_connection):
	if node_connection.subnetIndirectInput() is not None:
	    return node_connection.subnetIndirectInput()
	return node_connection.inputNode()
    }}}

::`inputItemOutputIndex(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::inputItemOutputIndex
    Returns zero if this connection has a subnet indirect input connected to
    it. Otherwise return the index of the output connection on the node that
    the input side of this connections connects to. In combination with the
    `inputItem` method, node and subnet indirect inputs can be processed
    through a common code path for many use cases.

::`isSelected(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::isSelected
    Return `True` if this connection is selected.

::`setSelected(self, selected, clear_all_selected = False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_NodeConnection::setSelected
    Selects or de-selects this connection. If the `clear_all_selected`
    parameter is set to `True`, all other selections (both connections,
    and nodes, network boxes, etc.) will be cleared before this connection
    is selected.
