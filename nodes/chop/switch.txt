"""Control the flow of channels through a CHOPnet."""

The Switch CHOP allows you to control the flow of channels through a
CHOPnet. It selects one of the input CHOPs by index and copies it
exactly. This is useful for selecting one of several "gestures" or
actions. Only one input chop can be selected at a time.

Inputs are indexed starting at `0`, so that the first input is `0`, the
second is `1`, and so on.

If the __First Input Is Index__ parameter is enabled, the first input is
used as the "switch" and the remaining inputs will be selection choices.
In this case, the second input will be indexed as `0`, the third as `1`, the
fourth as `2`, and so on (the Switch input CHOP is not indexed). The index
value is determined by evaluating the first channel in the first input
at the current frame. Only integer indices are used; fractional indices
will be rounded down to the closest integer.

If the index is less than `0`, then the index will be interpreted to be `0`.
If the index is greater than the number of input chops, the last input
CHOP is selected.


@parameters

    == Switch ==

        First Input Is Index:
            If on, use the first input CHOP's first channel to determine
            which input to select.
        Index:
            #channels: /index

            The input index to use if __First Input Is Index__ is off.
