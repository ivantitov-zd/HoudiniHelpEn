"""Allow (or disallow) an environment variable to overwrite the value of a
global variable saved in a hip file."""

:usage: `allowEnvironmentToOverwriteVariable(name, onoff)`

Note that you need to allow the variable to be overwritten from within
Houdini/hython _before_ loading in the hip file.

For example, suppose you set the `JOB` environment variable to
`/home/john/dyproject` and created a hip file in
`/home/john/myproject/hip/scene.hip`.  Your hip file could then reference
files using a `$JOB` prefix.  If you then moved your project to
`/mnt/projects/myproject` you cannot simply change the `JOB` environment
variable because Houdini saved the old value of `$JOB` to the hip file.  This
function lets you override the value of `$JOB` before you load the hip file, as
follows:
{{{
#!python
import os
os.environ["JOB"] = "/mnt/projects/myproject"
hou.allowEnvironmentVariableToOverwriteVariable("JOB", True)
hou.hipFile.load(os.path.expandvars("$JOB/hip/scene.hip"))
}}}
