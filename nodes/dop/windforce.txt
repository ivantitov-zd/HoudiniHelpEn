= Wind Force =

"""Applies forces to resist the current motion of objects relative to
a turbulent wind."""

Wind is an velocity sensitive force. If an object is already traveling at
the wind's velocity, then it will not receive any extra force from it. The
Wind Force DOP simulates a pushing force like wind, that can increase the
velocity of objects but not past its own speed.

NOTE:
    The drag force generated by this operator is applied independently of the object's mass.  Light objects will be affected more than heavy objects.  If the drag value is very large with respect to the timestep, some solvers can experience instability.

You can mask the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Mask Field DOP|Node:dop/mask] to the second input of this
node. The mask is added as subdata of the force data.

@parameters

    == Wind ==

        Velocity:
	    #id: vel
            #channels: /velx, /vely, /velz

            The velocity of the wind.
        Scale Force:
	    #id: forcescale
            #channels: /forcescale

            The applied force is equal to the negative of the current
            velocity, scaled by the Scale Force parameter.
        Sampling Mode:
            Allows you to choose between point, circle, or sphere as the sampling level.

    == Noise ==

        Seed:
            #id: seed
            #channels: /seed

            Random seed for the noise.
        Turbulence:
            #id: fractaldepth
            #channels: /fractaldepth

            The number of noise generations to use.
        Roughness:
            #id: roughness
            #channels: /roughness

            The amplitude reduction of higher frequency noise
            contributions.
        Exponent:
            #id: attenuation
            #channels: /attenuation

            Raises the noise to the given exponent.
        Frequency:
            #id: frequency
            #channels: /frequencyx /frequencyy /frequencyz

            The scale of the noise. Decreasing frequency increases feature
            size.
        Minimum Value:
            #id: minvalue
            #channels: /minvaluex /minvaluey /minvaluez

            Sets the minimum value that can be generated by the noise
            field.
        Maximum Value:
            #id: maxvalue
            #channels: /maxvaluex /maxvaluey /maxvaluez

            Sets the maximum value that can be generated by the noise
            field.
        Offset:
            #id: offsetx
            #channels: /offsetx /offsety /offsetz

            Allows the noise field to be effectively moved through space.
        Noise Type:
            Specifies the noise type.

            Hermite Interpolation:
                Fast, somewhat uniform.
            Sparse Convolution:
                Slower, more random.
            Improved Hermite:
                Fast, better randomness than Hermite Interpolation.
            Alligator Noise:
                Slow, cell-like noise.
