== Impact ==

Parameters on this tab control when the object to which this data is
applied can fracture.

Impact Group:
    An impact with objects in the specified group can potentially
    cause this object to fracture.

Min/Max Impact:
    The minimum impact impulse that can cause this object to fracture.
    Any impact over the minimum can cause a fracture; the range is
    used in conjunction with the __Radius Scale__ parameter, allowing
    heavier impacts to map to a larger impact radius.

    The minimum impact gets mapped to the minimum impact radius scale, and the maximum impact force gets mapped to the maximum impact scale. Having a maximum ensures that values are clipped so that really strong impacts from creating huge impact zone.
    
Minimum Volume:
    The minimum volume an object must have to be eligible for
    fracturing.  The object's volume is calculated by dividing its
    mass by its density.

    NOTE:
        This volume only work this way if you turn on __Compute Mass__ on your RBD Objects. If you don't, the volume will not be what you expect and you may have to just set it to 0.

Re-fracture Delay:
    The interval (in seconds of simulation time) after an object
    fractures before it can be eligible for fracturing again.
    
Fracture From Magnet Force Metaballs:
    Use the metaball geometry associated with any [Magnet
    Forces|Node:dop/magnetforce] applied to the object as a source for
    potential fracturing.  This can be used to cause explosion-type
    effects, where the magnet force itself causes the fracture.
    
Minimum Magnet Volume:
    The minimum ratio of the object's collision volume that must be
    overlapped by the magnet metaball before fracturing can occur.
    It can be useful to delay the fracturing until the metaball overlaps much of the object's volume when using animated metaball geometry.

Maximum Fractures:
    Controls how many times the object can break. A maximum fracture of 1 will break on the first impact, but the resulting pieces won't break again. A maximum fracture of 2 will allow all the pieces from the first fracture to break.

    NOTE:
        When some pieces break off the main chunk, the main chunk is still considered a "piece", which means it will lose one of its max fractures. 
    
Impact Radius:
    The radius of the metaball to be copied to each impact point.  

Min/Max Scale:
    Scale the impact radius by this amount, based upon the ranges
    specified in the __Minimum Impact__ parameter. __Radius scale__ multiplies the __Impact Radius__ gives you the size of metaball around each impact point. So given a single point of impact, it is roughly your crater radius. There are two values for the min/max.
    
    
== Points ==

Parameters on this tab control the generation of fracture points from
the eligible impacts.  See the [Voronoi Fracture
Points SOP|Node:sop/voronoifracturepoints] help for more information.

Compute Number of Fracture Points:
    Calculates the number of points to scatter in each fracture region
    based on its surface area.

Points Per Area:
    The number of points per unit of surface area.  This can be scaled
    by the __Point Density__ parameter for each region.

Number of Points:
    The number of points to generate.
    
Per Impact:
    Whether the __Number of Points__ parameter specifies the total
    number of generated points or the number of generated points for
    each impact point.
        
Show Fracture Points:
    Displays the generated points. Yellow is for the surface region, red for the interior, and blue for the exterior.
    
=== Surface === (surface)

Point Density:
    The density of point generation for this region.  If __Compute
    Number Of Points__ is enabled, this parameter is a multiplier of

    value is being used, this parameter determines the proportion of
    those points allocated to this region.
    
Surface Offset:
    The amount to offset the generated points from the object surface.
    Offsetting by a small amount can cause smaller, more debris-like
    fractured pieces from the Surface region.

    The amount to scale the impact radius before calculating the Surface region.

        Cluster all pieces in this region together as a single piece.
    
=== Interior === (interior)

Point Density:
    The density of point generation for this region.  If __Compute
    Number Of Points__ is enabled, this parameter is a multiplier of
    the __Points Per Area__ value. If an explicit __Number of Points__
    value is being used, this parameter determines the proportion of
    those points allocated to this region.
    
Clustering:
    Use Fracture Settings:
	Use the parameters on the [Cluster|#clustering] tab to control
	the size of the clustered pieces.
    Disabled:

    The density of point generation for this region.  If __Compute
    Number Of Points__ is enabled, this parameter is a multiplier of
    the __Points Per Area__ value. If an explicit __Number of Points__
    value is being used, this parameter determines the proportion of
    those points allocated to this region.

    At Impact:
        Scatter points at the boundary of the Interior and Exterior regions.
    Exterior Volume:
        Scatter points throughout the exterior volume.
    Both:
        Scatter points at both of the above locations.
        
Impact Offset:
    The offset of the Interior / Exterior boundary when scattering
    using the __At Impact__ or __Both__ setting above.
    
Clustering:
    Use Fracture Settings:
	Use the parameters on the [Cluster|#clustering] tab to control
	the size of the clustered pieces.
    Disabled:
        Disable clustering for every fractured piece from this region.

=== Cut ===
    
Cut Plane Offset:
    Offsets the cut plane between adjacent cell points before cutting.
    Increasing this has the effect of putting space between each fractured

=== Cluster === (clustering)

Cluster Pieces:
    Fuse the individual pieces into larger clusters based on their
    input points sharing a common, non-zero cluster attribute value.
    Values for this attribute can come from the generated fracture points,
    or from noise as specified below.
        
Size:
    The size of the cells for the noise added to the input points.  This 
    roughly corresponds to the size of the clusters.

    The offset of the noise added to the interior points.
    
Turbulence:
    The turbulence of the noise added to the interior points.
    
Depth / Noise Scale Bias:
    The value for the bias curve that maps depth within the surface to
    the amplitude of the noise applied.

== Velocity Transfer == (velocity)

Parameters on this tab control how velocity is transferred from the
intact object to the fractured pieces at the time of impact.
Fractured pieces can inherit velocity from the intact object's pre-
and post-impact velocity.  At the time of fracture, a velocity impulse
is also calculated for each fracturing impact, and is added to the
pieces' point velocities with a user-specified strength and falloff.
This impulse can add velocity to the pieces even when the intact
object has no velocity before or after impact.

Pre/Post Velocity Bias:
    The amount of pre- or post-impact velocity that the fractured
    pieces should inherit.  

    Setting this to a low value (biased towards pre-impact velocity) makes the pieces inherit little of the object's collision response, and the object will appear brittle, with little internal strength.  

    Setting this to a high value (biased towards post-impact velocity) causes the pieces to inherit much of the object's collision response, and the object will appear harder, with more internal strength.
    
Impulse Distance:
    The distance over which the velocity impulse falls off from each
    impact.  The impulse will have no effect past this distance.

Radial Impulse Scale:
    A scale for the radial component of the velocity impulse.
    Increasing this value will give velocity in an outwards direction
    from the fracturing impacts to the pieces within the Impulse
    Distance.
    
Normal Impulse Scale:
    A scale for the normal component of the velocity impulse.
    Increasing this value will give velocity (in the direction of the
    collision response) to the pieces within the __Impulse Distance__, even
    if the velocity bias for the entire object is towards pre-impact
    velocities.
