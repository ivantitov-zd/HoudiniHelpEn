= Point Cloud Write =

"""This function writes data for the current shading point out to a point cloud file."""

This VOP uses the name of the output point cloud file and up to 2
label/value pairs to write the data into a point cloud file.  Point cloud
files are useful for calculating subsurface scattering, ambient occlusion
and indirect diffuse.

You can add a channel labeled `interpolate` and put a value of 1
in the matching data input.  An interpolated point is written representing the 
four corners of a micropolygon. This prevents writing out overlapping values.

NOTE:
    `interpolate` cannot be used as the name of any data channel.


@inputs

filename:
    The name of the file to write the point cloud into. These should use a .pc extension.
	Houdini uses the extension to determine how to import the file.

ch1:
	This string labels the attribute to save in `filename.pc`, 
	such as `P`, `N`, `v`, `area`, `u`, etc.

d1:
    This is the data (float, integer, vector, color, point, normal, whatever) to put in the channel, named above, of the point cloud, `filename.pc`.

ch2:
	This string labels the next attribute to save in `filename.pc`,. This string is the name for the next channel.

d2:
    This is the data (float, integer, vector, color, point, normal, whatever) to put in the channel, named above, of the point cloud, `filename.pc`.

mkdir:
    Create intermediate directories.


@outputs

success:
    This is an integer, 0 for failed and 1 for success.
	If this operation fails, first check the filename path is correct
	and that the permissions allow writing to that file.
