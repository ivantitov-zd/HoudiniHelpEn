= Interpolate =

"""Treats its multiple-inputs as keyframes and interpolates between
them."""

This CHOP treats its multiple-inputs as keyframes and interpolates
between them. The inputs are usually single-frame CHOPs like those
produced by a [Constant CHOP|constant]. The Interpolate CHOP first sorts the input
CHOPs in time (without shifting them) and interpolates between them to
fill the gaps.

The number of channels in the output is the same as the number of
channels in the first input.

If a channel is missing in an input, and Match By is set to Name, it is
treated as if there is no keyframe at that frame for that channel, and
the interpolation occurs between CHOPs before and after that frame.

When the graph is displayed as timebars, and you click on the black
lines of the Interpolate CHOP time bar which represent the inputs of the
CHOP, you can drag the line to change the time of that input. It goes to
that input and changes the value if its "start" parameter, so you can
re-time the keyframes.

When you Shift-click on a black line, the current CHOP changes to the
corresponding input, so you can edit its values.

This CHOP has Sample Rate Match options in the Common page.


@parameters

== Interpolate ==

    Shape:
        The shape of the interpolation curve.

        Linear:
            A straight line.
        Ease In:
            Exponential rise.
        Ease Out:
            Exponential fall.
        Ease In Ease Out:
            Half cosine blend.
        Cubic:
            A cubic spline.
        Add:
            Overlapping parts, if any, are added.
    Overlap Priority:
        If an input is not a single frame, and if there are overlaps in
        the input CHOPs, an option is used to resolve the conflict.

        First Segment has Priority:
            Use the segment with the earliest start time.
        Last Segment has Priority:
            Use the segment with the latest start time.
        Average Overlap:
            Combine the conflicting channels by averaging them.
