Returns the color of the environment texture in the direction given by the `reflect_dir` argument. The signatures that specify four vectors filter the map pixels found within the cone defined by the vectors.  Rather than specifying a filtering cone by providing four vectors, it is also possible to indicate an angle to filter over using the filter_angle argument with a single reflection direction.

The environment function can also be used to look up intensity values in an IES photometric light map, with the correct angular mapping applied.

NOTE:
    To perform environment map lookups in object space, you'll need to first transform the direction vector using the vtransform() function.
