= Hair Clump =

"""Clumps guide curves together."""

The center and shape of each clump can be controlled using explicitly provided
curves or a set of curves selected from the input curves.

@parameters

== General ==

=== General ===

Blend:
    [Include:fur_common#opblend]

[Include:/nodes/sop/fur_common#useskinmask]

[Include:/nodes/sop/fur_common#skinmaskattrib]

Clump Size:
    #id: clumpsize

    Create clumps of this size. When no clump curves are provided, uses a
    a set of curves from the first input with that are spaced such that
    clumps have roughly this size.

    When clump curves are provided via the first input, use the clump size
    as the influence radius.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Search Beyond Clump Radius:
    #id: searchbeyondradius

    Curves are affected even if they are outside of the radius of all clump
    curves.

Crossover Rate:
    #id: crossoverrate

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Random Seed:
    #id: seed

    The seed used for various random effects.

=== Shape ===

Preserve Length Differences:
    #id: preservelength

    Ensure that relative length differences among the curves of a clump are
    preserved. When disabled, the points of each curve are simply moved towards
    the corresponding location on the clump curve, which causes the tips of
    all curves to end at the same location. This is faster but tends to look
    less natural.

Extend To Match:
    #id: extendtomatch

    Extends all curves such that the longest curve in a clump reaches the tip
    of the clump curve's tip.

Shorten To Match:
    #id: shortentomatch

    Shortens all curve such that the longest curve in a clump is just long
    enough to reach the clump curve's tip.

Accurate Bundling:
    #id: accuratebundling

    Take into account the width of curves for clumping (as defined by the `width`
    attribute). This prevents curves from collapsing onto the clump curve
    where tightness is `1.0`.

Hair Width:
    #id: hairwidth

    Use this width for __Accurate Bundling__ when curves have no `width` attribute.

Hair Width Scale:
    #id: hairwidthscale

    Multiply curve width by this value for the purpose of __Accurate Bundling__.

Tightness:
    #id: tightness

    Controls how tightly curves are clumped.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Stray Amount:
    #id: amount

    Amount to stray from the the clump. Higher values cause clump curves to
    have less of an effect. This effect is usually limited to a percentage
    of curves using the __Stray Rate__ parameter.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Stray Rate:
    #id: strayrate

    The percentage of curves to which are allowed to stray from their clump.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Stray Falloff:
    #id: strayfalloff

    Controls the strength of the stray effect with distance from the clump
    center. Higher values cause curves close to the center to stray less.

Clump Profile:
    #id: clumpprofile

    Controls the tightness of the clump along it's length.

== Fractal Clumping ==

Fractal clumping performs multiple iterations of clumping with smaller clump
sizes.

When providing clump curves, they are used for the first iteration. Successive
iterations use a subset of curves from the input guide curves. The density
and size of these clumps is defined by the __Clump Size__.

Iterations:
    #id: iterations

    Clump this number of times.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Goal Feedback:
    #id: goalfeedback

    Controls how much the clumping effect of an iteration feeds into the clump
    curves of the next iteration.

    A value of `0.0` causes each iteration to be performed as if nothing had
    happened before it.

    A value of `1.0` uses the curve shapes computed in the previous iteration.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Size Reduction:
    #id: sizereduction

    Reduce clump size by this factor after each iteration.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Tightness Reduction:
    #id: tightnessreduction

    Reduce tightness by this factor after each iteration.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

== Curling ==

Curling:
    #id: enablecurling

    Curls clump curves before performing clumping.

Amplitude:
    #id: curlamp

    The radius of the curl effect.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Amplitude Ramp:
    #id: curlampramp

    Controls the amplitude along the length of the curve.

Frequency:
    #id: curlfreq

    The number of full turns per length unit.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Frequency Ramp:
    #id: curlfreqramp

    Controls the frequency along the length of the curve.
