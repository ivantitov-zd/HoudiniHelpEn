= RBD Packed Object =

""" Creates a single DOP object from SOP Geometry that represents a number of RBD Objects."""

The RBD Packed Object DOP creates a single DOP Object inside the DOP simulation. It takes the geometry from the given SOP Path and uses each [packed primitive|/model/packed] in the geometry to represent a single RBD object. Each packed primitive contains the collision geometry for an RBD object, and attributes on the primitive's point are used to store information such as orientation, mass, and velocity.

The resulting DOP Object represents large numbers of objects in a more efficient manner than the [RBD Fractured Object DOP|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject] or the [RBD Point Object DOP|Node:dop/rbdpointobject]. This object representation is currently only understood by the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

NOTE:
        In Houdini 13, RBD Packed Objects can't interact with other solvers such as cloth and fluids.

== Point Attributes ==

The [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver] uses several point attributes to
store the properties of each piece of a packed object.

        td>> Integer
        td>>
            Specifies whether the object's transform should be updated from its SOP geometry at each timestep. This attribute is only used if the `active` attribute is set to 0. The default value is set by the __Initial Object Type__ parameter.
    tr>>
        td>> `bounce`
        td>> Float
        td>>

        td>> Integer
        td>>
            When enabled, any impacts that occur during the simulation will be recorded in the __Impacts__ or __Feedback__ data. Enabling this option may cause the simulation time and memory usage to increase.

        td>> Integer
        td>>
            Specifies whether the object should be completely ignored by the Bullet solver. Unlike setting the `active` attribute to zero, other objects in the simulation will not be able to collide against this object.

        td>>
            The mass of an object is its volume times its density. The default value is set by the __Density__ parameter.
    tr>>
        td>> `friction`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The coefficient of friction of the object. A value of 0 means the object is frictionless. The default value is set by the __Friction__ parameter.
    tr>>
        td>> `inertialtensorstiffness`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            A scale factor that is applied to the inertial tensor of the object. A higher stiffness will make the object less likely to spin. The default value is set by the __Rotational Stiffness__ parameter.

    tr>>
        td>> `mass`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The mass of the object. If `computemass` is non-zero, this value will be computed automatically by the solver. Otherwise, the default value will be set by the __Mass__ parameter.
    tr>>
        td>> `name`
        td>> String
        td>>
            A unique name for the object. This value is used by [Constraint Networks|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] to identify constraints that should be attached to this object.

        td>> Vector
        td>>
            The pivot point that the orientation is applied to. If `computecom` is non-zero, this will be computed from the object's collision shape. Otherwise, the value is set from the __Center of Mass__ parameter.

=== Collision Shape Attributes ===

The following attributes can be used to customize the collision shape for each object.

table>>
    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Type
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_adjust_geometry`
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            Shrinks the collision geometry to prevent the __Collision Padding__ from increasing the effective size of the object.
            This can improve the simulation's performance by preventing initially closely-packed collision shapes from interpenetrating, and also removes the gap between objects caused by the __Collision Padding__.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_autofit`
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            Specifies whether to use the bounds of the object's geometry to compute the collision shape when __Geometry Representation__ is __Box__, __Capsule__, __Cylinder__, __Sphere__, or __Plane__.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_collision_margin`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            A padding distance between shapes, which is used by the Bullet engine to improve the reliability and performance of the collision detection. You may need to scale this value depending on the scale of your scene. This padding increases the size of the collision shape, so it is recommended to enable __Shrink Collision Geometry__ to prevent the collision shape from growing.
            This option is not supported for the __Concave__ or __Plane__ geometry representations.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_georep`
        td>> String
        td>>
            The collision shape used to represent the object. Possible values are `convexhull`, `concave`, `box`, `capsule`, `cylinder`, `compound`, `sphere`, and `plane`.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_groupconnected`
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            When __Geometry Representation__ is __Convex Hull__, specifies whether the solver should create a compound shape that contains a separate convex hull collision shape for each set of connected primitives in the geometry.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_length`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The length of the __Capsule__ or __Cylinder__ collision shape in the Y direction. If __AutoFit__ is enabled, this value will be computed automatically from the object's geometry.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_primR`
        td>> Vector
        td>>
            The orientation of the __Box__, __Capsule__, __Cylinder__, or __Plane__ collision shape in the Bullet world. If __AutoFit__ is enabled, this value will be computed automatically from the object's geometry.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_primS`
        td>> Vector
        td>>
            The size of the __Box__ collision shape. If __AutoFit__ is enabled, this value will be computed automatically from the object's geometry.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_primT`
        td>> Vector
        td>>
            The position of the __Box__, __Sphere__, __Capsule__, __Cylinder__, or __Plane__ collision shape in the Bullet world. If __AutoFit__ is enabled, this value will be computed automatically from the object's geometry.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_radius`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The radius of the __Sphere__, __Capsule__, or __Cylinder__ collision shape. If __AutoFit__ is enabled, this value will be computed automatically from the object's geometry.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_shrink_amount`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Specifies the amount of resizing done by __Shrink Collision Geometry__.

=== Collision Attributes ===

The attributes listed below can be used to ignore collisions against other
objects in the simulation.

table>>
    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Type
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> `activationignore`
        td>> String
        td>>
            If the object is inactive and has a positive
            `min_activation_impulse` value, it will not be activated by
            collisions with any objects that match this pattern. The pattern
            uses the same syntax as the `collisionignore` attribute.
    tr>>
        td>> `activationxformgroup`
        td>> String
        td>>
            For an agent, specifies which of its rigid bodies should be activated when using the `min_activation_impulse` attribute.
            The default behavior is to activate all of the agent's rigid bodies.
            This attribute is expected to contain the name of a [transform group|Node:sop/agenttransformgroup] that specifies which joints' rigid bodies should be activated.
    tr>>
        td>> `collisiongroup`
        td>> String
        td>>
            Specifies the name of a collision group that this object belongs
            to. This can be used by the `collisionignore` attribute to ignore
            collisions against specific groups of objects.
    tr>>
        td>> `collisionignore`
        td>> String
        td>>
            The object will not collide against any objects that match this
            pattern. This pattern can use the name of DOP objects, the ID of
            DOP objects, DOP groups, or the `collisiongroup` point attribute of
            a packed primitive in an [RBD Packed
            Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject].  The [POP Collision
            Ignore|Node:dop/popcollisionignore] node can be used to generate
            this attribute.

            * `*` will disable all collisions, and an empty string will enable all collisions.

            * `* ^object1` will cause the object to only collide against the DOP object whose name is `object1`.

            * `wall*` will disable collisions against packed primitives whose `collisiongroup` attribute begins with `wall` (or DOP objects whose name begins with `wall`).

            * `object1/wall*` will disable collisions against packed primitives from the DOP object `object1` whose `collisiongroup` attribute begins with `wall`.
    tr>>
        td>> `min_activation_impulse`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The minimum impulse from a collision that will cause the object to switch from inactive to active. The activation occurs at the instant that the collision occurs.
            The `activationignore` attribute can be used to prevent the object from being activated by collisions with particular objects.

=== Speed Limit Attributes ===

The attributes listed below can be used to clamp the linear or angular speed of specific objects.
The clamping is performed during each substep after forces and constraints have been applied (but before positions are updated), so this enforces a hard limit on the object's speed.
If the attribute value is negative, no clamping is performed.
For animated or deforming static objects, the speed limit affects the velocities used when resolving collisions.
The [POP Speed Limit|Node:dop/popspeedlimit] node can be used to generate these attributes.

table>>
    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Type
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> `speedmin`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The slowest speed (in units/second) that an object can move. This does not affect stationary objects.
    tr>>
        td>> `speedmax`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The fastest speed (in units/second) that an object can move.
    tr>>
        td>> `spinmin`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The slowest speed (in radians/second) that an object can rotate. This does not affect non-spinning objects.
    tr>>
        td>> `spinmax`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The fastest speed (in radians/second) that an object can rotate.

The attributes listed below can be used to limit the _change_ in the object's linear or angular velocity when solving constraints and collisions.
This does not affect changes to the object's velocity due to external forces, and is enforced each frame after constraints have been solved and positions have been updated.
This can be useful to tame collisions that produce very high linear or angular velocities.
If the value is negative, no clamping is performed.

:note:
    For best results, it is recommended to clamp both linear and angular acceleration simultaneously.

    Setting the max acceleration to a very low value can introduce jitter for situations such as objects resting on the ground plane.
    With such values, the contact constraints cannot change the object's velocity by enough to counter the acceleration due to gravity.

    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Type
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> `accelmax`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Limits the change in the object's speed that is caused by enforcing constraints.
    tr>>
        td>> `angaccelmax`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Limits the change in the object's angular speed that is caused by enforcing constraints.

=== Force Attributes ===(forceattributes)

The attributes listed below can be used to apply forces to specific objects. Nodes such as [POP Force|Node:dop/popforce] and [POP Drag|Node:dop/popdrag] can be used to generate these forces.

table>>
    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Type
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> `airresist`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Specifies how important it is to match the target velocity (`targetv`).
    tr>>
        td>> `drag`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            When an object is dragged by the `targetv` and `airresist` attributes, this attribute is used to further scale the drag amount.
    tr>>
        td>> `dragexp`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Higher drag exponents cause objects that are far from `targetv` or `targetw` to recover faster than those that are already close to the target velocity.
    tr>>
        td>> `force`
        td>> Vector
        td>>
            Specifies a force that will be applied to the center of mass of the object.
    tr>>
        td>> `spinresist`
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Specifies how important it is to match the target angular velocity (`targetw`).
    tr>>
        td>> `targetv`
        td>> Vector
        td>>
            Specifies a target velocity for the object. This is used in combination with the `airresist` attribute to compute a force that will move the object towards the desired velocity.
    tr>>
        td>> `targetw`
        td>> Vector
        td>>
            Specifies a target angular velocity for the object. This is used in combination with the `spinresist` attribute to compute a torque that will move the object towards the desired angular velocity.
    tr>>
        td>> `torque`
        td>> Vector
        td>>
            Specifies a torque that will be applied to the object.

=== Agent Attributes ===(agentattributes)

For agent primitives, a rigid body is created for each transform in its rig that has at least one shape attached to it in the agent's collision layer.
Array attributes are used for properties that can vary for each of an agent's rigid bodies, and the attributes are named with the `_agent` suffix.
The arrays are indexed using the transform index from the agent's rig.

The following array attributes are required:

* `bullet_autofit_valid_agent`
* `bullet_length_agent`
* `bullet_primR_agent`
* `bullet_primS_agent`
* `bullet_primT_agent`
* `bullet_radius_agent`
* `bullet_sleeping_agent`
* `deactivation_time_agent`
* `mass_agent`
* `orient_agent`
* `pivot_agent`
* `trans_agent`
* `v_agent`
* `w_agent`

The following array attributes are optional and can be used instead of the regular point attributes if varying values are needed.
* `active_agent`
* `activationignore_agent`
* `activationxformgroup_agent`
* `bounce_agent`
* `density_agent`
* `force_agent`
* `friction_agent`
* `inertialtensorstiffness_agent`
* `min_activation_impulse_agent`
* `torque_agent`

The attributes listed below can also be used for agent primitives.

table>>
    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Type
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_updateagentxform`
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            Specifies whether the solver should update the agent's overall transform (e.g. the `P` and `orient` point attributes) based on the root rigid body's motion.
            This option is useful for a full ragdoll so that the agent's point follows its motion, but may cause issues for a partial ragdoll where the agent's overall transform is already being updated elsewhere (e.g. by the [crowd solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver]).

=== Reserved Solver Attributes ===

Below is a list of attributes that are maintained internally by the solver. You should not modify these attributes yourself.

table>>
    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Class
        th>> Type
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_autofit_valid`
        td>> Point
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            When __AutoFit__ is enabled, this value stores whether the solver has already computed collision shape attributes such as `bullet_length` and `bullet_primT`.
    tr>>
        td>> `bullet_sleeping`
        td>> Point
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            Tracks whether the object has been put to sleep by the solver.
            This occurs after the object and any nearby / constrained objects have been below the __Linear Threshold__ and __Angular Threshold__ for a period of time.
            
            NOTE:
                When manually waking an object, the `deactivation_time` attribute should also be set to zero so that the object isn't immediately put back to sleep.
    tr>>
        td>> `deactivation_time`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>>
            The amount of time that the object's speed has been below the __Linear Threshold__ or __Angular Threshold__. The solver uses this value to disable simulation of objects that have been inactive for a period of time.
    tr>>
        td>> `found_overlap`
        td>> Point
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            When the solver sees an object for the first time, it checks whether that object is initially overlapping with any other objects in the simulation and prevents any such pairs of objects from being forced apart. This value is used by the solver to determine whether it has performed this process for the object on a previous frame.
    tr>>
        td>> `id`
        td>> Point
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            A unique identifier for the object. This value is used by the solver to identify objects that have been added to or removed from the simulation.
    tr>>
        td>> `nextid`
        td>> Detail
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            Stores the `id` that the solver will assign to the next new object that is added.

@parameters
    Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
        Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  The latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the DOP network level.
    Creation Frame:
        The frame number on which the object will be created. The object is created only when the current frame number is equal to this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be created. 

	For example, if this value is set to 3.5, the __Timestep__ parameter of the DOP Network must be changed to `1/(2*$FPS)` to ensure the DOP Network has a timestep at frame `3.5`.
    Initial Object Type:
        Specifies the initial state of the objects. The `active`, `animated`, and `deforming` point attributes can be used to vary these values on a per object basis.
        For animated and deforming objects, the `name` point attribute is used to find the matching packed primitive from the __SOP Path__.

        Create Active Objects:
            The objects will be simulated and react to other objects in the simulation.
        Create Static Objects:
            The objects will not move or react to other objects in the simulation.
        Create Animated Static Objects:
            The objects' transforms will be updated on each timestep from the __SOP Path__, but the objects will not react to other objects in the simulation.
        Create Deforming Static Objects:
            The objects' collision shapes will be rebuilt on each timestep from the __SOP Path__, but the objects will not react to other objects in the simulation.
        Create Deforming Active Objects:
            The objects will be simulated and react to other objects in the simulation, and their collision shapes will also be rebuilt on each timestep from the __SOP Path__.
    Geometry Source:
        Specifies the source of the objects' geometry.

        SOP:
            Use the SOP specified by the __SOP Path__ parameter.
        First Context Geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's first input.
        Second Context Geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's second input.
        Third Context Geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's third input.
        Fourth Context Geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's fourth input.
    SOP Path:
        The path to a SOP (or an Object, in which case the display SOP is used) which will be the geometry for this object.
    Overwrite Attributes from SOP:
        When enabled, specifies a list of point attributes that will be updated on each frame from the __SOP Path__. The `name` point attribute is used to find the matching packed primitive from the SOP geometry.
    Use Object Transform:
        The transform of the object containing the chosen SOP is applied to the geometry. This is useful if the initial location of the geometry is defined by an object transform. 
    Display Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry is displayed in the viewport.  Does not reset the simulation when it is changed.

        Simulation Geometry:
            The objects' geometry is displayed in the viewport.

        Render Geometry:
            The geometry specified by the __Render SOP Path__ parameter is transformed to match the simulation geometry and is displayed in the viewport.
            This is useful for visualizing the results of the simulation when using lower resolution shapes for the simulation geometry.

    Render SOP Path:
        Specifies the SOP geometry to use when __Display Geometry__ is set to __Render Geometry__.

    == Initial State ==

        Position:
            Initial position in world space of the object.
        Rotation:
            Initial orientation of the object. This is in RX/RY/RZ format.
        Velocity:
            Initial velocity of the object.
        Angular Velocity:
            Initial angular velocity of the object. This is the axis of rotation times the rate of rotation. Speed of rotation is measured in degrees per second, so a value of 360 will cause
            the object to rotate once per second.
        Inherit Velocity from Point Velocity:
            If enabled, the `v` and `w` point attributes of the source geometry will override the object's initial velocity.

    == Physical ==

        Compute Center of Mass:
            Specifies that the object's center of mass should be computed automatically from its collision shape on the next frame it is solved.
        Inherit Pivot from Point Position:
            Sets the center of mass to the packed primitive's initial point position.
        Pivot:
            Specifies the object's center of mass.
        Compute Mass:
            Determines if the mass will be calculated automatically from the object's volumetric representation and glued sub-objects.
        Density:
            The mass of an object is its volume times its density.
        Mass:
            The absolute mass of the object.
        Rotational Stiffness:
            When an object receives a glancing blow, it will often acquire a spin. The amount of spin acquired depends on the shape and mass distribution of the object, known as the
            _inertial tensor_. 

	    The __Rotational Stiffness__ is a scale factor applied to this. A higher stiffness will make the object less liable to spinning, a lower value will make it more ready to spin.
