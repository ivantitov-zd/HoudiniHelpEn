"""Copies capture attributes from one half of a symmetric model to the other."""

A correspondence is established between each point
of the source side of the model (the side in which the arrow is on) with
the closest mirrored point on the destination side. This allows you to
paint capture weights (using the [Capture Layer Paint
SOP|Node:sop/capturelayerpaint]) on one half of a character, and have
those weights applied to the other half.

Before mirroring capture weights, your skin geometry must be captured to
bones or metaballs using the [Bone Capture SOP|Node:sop/capture], the
[Bone Capture Proximity SOP|Node:sop/captureproximity], or the [Capture
Metaball SOP|Node:sop/capturemeta]. Both the source (From) and
destination (To) regions or metaball groups have to be specified in this
initial capture.

The From and To fields specify a list of capture regions or metaball
groups that are to be mirrored. Both the from and to list orders are
important; capture regions are matched by their orders in their
respective lists. For example, to mirror the right arm to the left arm
one might have:

`From`: `"ruparm/cregion 0" "rlowarm/cregion 0" "rhand/cregion 0"`

`To`: `"luparm/cregion 0" "llowarm/cregion 0" "lhand/cregion 0"`

Pattern substitution rules may be used for the `From` and `To` parameters,
please see the examples in [Attrib String Edit|Node:sop/attribstringedit].

@parameters
    Group:
        #channels: /group

        Specifies a subset of points to affect.
    Use Group As:
        #channels: /usegroupas

        Specifies whether the Group field specifies the set of source or
        destination points.
    Capture Type:
        #channels: /capturetype

	Whether to use [Bone Capture|Node:sop/capture], [Muscle
	Capture|Node:/sop/musclecapture] or [Metaball
	Capture|Node:sop/capturemeta] when mirroring. That is, whether to
	mirror the `boneCapture`, `muscleCapture` or `metaCapture` attributes.
    Behavior:
        #channels: /mirrorop

        How to treat unspecified capture regions. These also change the
        behavior of the capturing. Each choice is associated with a
        different workflow.


        Copy Unmirrored Captures:
            With this option, the destination point's capture weights
            are replaced by the source point's weights. Any bone or
            metaball object listed in the From parameter is changed to
            the corresponding object in the To parameter, and
            vice-versa. This operation is only done to one side of the
            model, the side the mirror arrow points away from.

            This choice is best when one has one side of the model
            properly weighted and wishes to recreate the weights on the
            other side.

        Leave Unmirrored Captures:
            This option processes all selected points. Each point's
            weights for bones or metaball objects specified in the To
            parameter are deleted, and then the mirror point's From bone
            or metaball weights are copied in after they've undergone
            the From->To conversion.

            This choice is best when one has the From objects properly
            weighted and wishes to make the To bones symmetric copies.
            It does not affect the weights for unlisted bones or
            objects.

        Average Weights:
            This option processes all selected points. Each point's
            weights are added to the weights of its mirror point after
            the mirror point's bones or metaball objects have undergone
            the from->to and to->from conversion. The point's capture
            weights are then normalized.

            This choice is best when combining the above workflows. It
            ensures a symmetrical weighting and does not damage
            cross-boundary feathering. One should note that *all* of the
            models weights are used - spurious weights will be spread to
            the other side of the model.

    Origin:
        #channels: /origin{xyz}

        The origin of the reflection plane.
    Distance:
        #channels: /dist

        Distance to move reflection plane.
    Direction:
        #channels: /dir{xyz}

        Direction of the reflection plane's normal. This normal should
        face the source points when "Copying" unspecified capture
        regions.
    From:
        #channels: /from

        This is a space delimited list of quoted relative paths of
        capture regions or metaballs to act as the source objects. If
        you're using bones, specify the bone's name and the capture
        region primitive number (as in `"ruparm/cregion 0"`). If you're
        using metaballs, specify the metaball object's name and the
        group name (as in `"ruparm/muscle biceps"`). If you're using muscles, 
	then the names as specified in the `Muscle ID` parameter of the
	corresponding [Muscle|Node:obj/riggedmuscle] object.

	Pattern matching rules can be used here, which are the same as the
	examples in [Attrib String Edit|Node:sop/attribstringedit].
    To:
        #channels: /to

        To is specified using the same format as From, but specifies the
        destination bones or metaball object. The two lists form a
        one-to-one correspondence, so their order is important. If these
        regions aren't already captured, this will be captured using their
        rest transforms.

	Pattern matching rules can be used here, which are the same as the
	examples in [Attrib String Edit|Node:sop/attribstringedit].
    Point Coloring:
        #channels: /color

        Whether to apply coloring to the incoming geometry by capture
        region.

        Default Source Color:
            Leave the source geometry coloring as-is.
        Color by Capture Region:
            Apply point coloring based on either the capture region's
            assigned color or the metaball group's assigned color.
    Zero Weight Point Color:
        #channels: /zeroweightcolor{rgb}

        The color to apply to points when they are not weighted by any
        capture regions or metaball groups.
