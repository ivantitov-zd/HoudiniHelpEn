= Pipe In =

"""Pipes data from custom devices into a CHOP, without needing the Houdini Developers' Kit or knowledge of Houdini internals."""

You can use a "named pipe" or "FIFO" (first in, first out) on Linux and Mac OS X (see `man -S 7 pipe`) or a network connection (for remote connections) on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. 

You need a program that gets values from the input device, and outputs them
into a file specified in Filename or a Network port. Your custom program writes
formatted messages into the file or port, and the Pipe In CHOP reads it,
creating the channels specified in the messages.

== Networking into Houdini ==

You can receive network data from another server (e.g. from a
Houdini [Pipe Out CHOP|pipeout] running remotely). A connection must be
established between the server and the Pipe In CHOP before data is
sent. Do this by changing the Source from Pipe to Network). You must
supply the Server Address and Port from which to receive incoming
data to a channel. The server should be listening for connections on
the port that this CHOP is using.

To setup a link between two Houdini processes, one process should
have a [Pipe Out CHOP|pipeout] active (thus listening for connections) on an
arbitrary port (i.e. port #5010). The second Houdini uses a Pipe In
CHOP with the network address set to the name of the machine that
the first Houdini process is running on. The network port should be
set to the same port as the server (in this case, 5010). The port
number can be any number between 5000 and 10000, as long as it is
consistent between the Pipe In and [Pipe Out|pipeout] CHOPs. For more than one
connection, use distinct port numbers. Pipe In/Out CHOPs with
matching port numbers on different machines should automatically
sense one another.

If you just want to send data from a local process to Houdini, set the server address to `localhost`.

== Programming the Pipe In CHOP ==

The Pipe In chop is designed to allow you to program an interface to
chops that do not require a Houdini Developers Kit.

The Pipe In CHOP allows Houdini to read information in a special
formats described here from a FIFO (First In, First Out) file and
create CHOP channels. As long as the correct formats are used,
Houdini will be able to get data from any source including devices
such as a joystick, microphone or PuppetWorks' hardware.

The Pipe In CHOP has two parameters and parses three command
formats. The first parameter specifies which file to read from and
the second toggles between active (reading) and inactive (discards
data) modes. The formats supported allow the following
functionality: upload the most current sample data, upload all
sample data and create a full waveform, and upload the channel
names.

=== Using the Pipe In CHOP ===

In order to read information with this chop, a separate
application has to be developed to write to a FIFO in the proper
format. The following sections describe and give sample code
(written in C) for opening a file and writing values that will
be accepted by the Pipe In CHOP.

=== Opening a Fifo File ===

To create a file that the Pipe In CHOP will read from, use the
following code to open a new FIFO called FIFO_NAME. Define
FIFO_NAME to be the desired file name to create. The output
stream that is used for writing will block until a reader is
connected to the file.

{{{
#include    <sys/types.h>
#include    <sys/stat.h>
#include    <stdio.h>
mode_t       prev_mask;
FILE        *output = 0;
/* Create a new fifo */
prev_mask = umask(0);
mkfifo (FIFO_NAME, 0666);
umask(prev_mask);
/* Open the file for writing */
fprintf(stderr,
"Awaiting reader of FIFO %s\n\r", FIFO_NAME);
output = fopen(FIFO_NAME, "wb");
}}}

=== Writing To The File ===

The Pipe In chop reads information from the FIFO in eight-byte
big endian chunks of data called tokens, so it is necessary to
write to the file in the same format. There is also a method in
place for sending an escape character in case a reset is required
in the middle of parsing a command.

NOTE:
    In versions prior to Houdini 12, 4 byte tokens were used instead of 8
    byte tokens.

The reset character is an integer value of `170`. When this byte
is received, followed by a byte with a value of zero, the
current parsing is reset. In order to send a value of `170`
without the command being reset, two bytes with a 170 value must
be sent consecutively so that the Pipe In CHOP will disregard
the first value.

{{{
#define ESCAPE_CHARACTER        170
void
write_byte(char b, FILE *output)
{
    /* Prepend escape character */
    if (b == ESCAPE_CHARACTER)
      fputc(ESCAPE_CHARACTER, output); 
      fputc(b, output);
}
void
write_values(const char *p, int size, FILE *output)
{
    int          i;
    for(i=0; i<size; i++)
      write_byte(p[i], output);
}
void
send_reset(FILE *output)
{
    fputc(ESCAPE_CHARACTER, output);
    fputc(0, output);
    fputc(ESCAPE_CHARACTER, output);
    fputc(0, output);
    fputc(ESCAPE_CHARACTER, output);
    fputc(0, output);
    fputc(ESCAPE_CHARACTER, output);
    fputc(0, output);
    fflush(output);
}
}}}

Using these functions, any 8 bytes of data (e.g. 00000001, 3.141,
Chan, ...) can be sent to the file. To send a reset signal, four
escape sequences are written to pad to 8 bytes. It is a good idea
to send a reset signal before the command and flush the FIFO at
the end of a command.

{{{
int64       token;
double	    sample;
send_reset(output); 
/* Send a command here */
write_values((char *)&token, sizeof(token), output);
write_values((char *)&sample, sizeof(sample), output);
fflush(output);
}}}

NOTE:
    An escape character (170) can be sent, followed by any
    other character, to stop the current command parsing and
    begin again.  If the 170-170 sequence is sent, the first
    character is ignored and the value is sent normally.

=== Command Type #1: Current Values ===

The first type of command that the Pipe In CHOP will read is
used to get the most recent channel data. It has a default
sample rate of 30 samples per second, CHOP length of 1, and a
start position of `0`. This command allows the number of channels
to be set and the samples associated with those channels to be
read.

(int64) 1:
    Command Type.
(int64):
    Number of Channels.
(double):
    Sample Data, one sample for each channel.

=== Command Type #2: Upload ===

The second type of command that can be parsed is used to upload
a full set of samples to create a waveform. The sample rate,
track length, start position, number of channels, and samples
for each channel to fill the track length must be provided. The
channel samples must be interleaved so that all the channels for
one index are filled before moving forward to the next index.

(int64) 2:
    Command Type.
(int64):
    Track Length.
(double):
    Sample Rate.
(double):
    Start Index.
(int64):
    Number of Channels.
(double):
    Sample Data, one sample for each channel for each index.

=== Command Type #3: Channel Names ===

This command allows the channels to be assigned names before
they are created. Since the names are usually strings, it is
important to remember to write them as eight-byte tokens (padded
with zeroes at the end if necessary) so they will be parsed
correctly. This format requires the number of names to be set,
followed by the name length (in number of eight-byte tokens) and
name data for each channel.

(int64) 3:
    Command Type
(int64):
    Number of Names

For each name, the following data is read:

(int64):
    Name Length, one per name
(char*):
    Name Chunks (char\[8\] * _Name Length_)

=== Command Type #4: Disconnect ===

This command causes the Pipe In CHOP to disconnect the network connection. It
is typically sent by the [Pipe Out CHOP|pipeout] when its Active parameter is
turned off or if the node is bypassed.

(int64) 4:
    Command Type

=== Additional commands ===

{{{
delay refresh
    (int64)	5 - command type
    (int64)	- seconds to delay

script
    (int64)	6 - command type
    (int64)	- Script Length
    (char*)	- Script Chunks (char[8] * Script Length)
}}}

=== Writing a Command ===

Using command type 1 as an example, the following function could
be used to send a command to the FIFO which will be read by the
Pipe In CHOP.

{{{
void
send_current_values(FILE *output, int num, double *samples)
{
    int64       token;
    int         j;
    send_reset(output);             /* just to be safe */
    /* Command Type */
    token = 1;
    write_values((char *)&token, sizeof(token), output);
    /* Number of Channels */
    token = num;
    write_values((char *)&token, sizeof(token), output);
    /* Sample Values */
    for(j=0; j<num; j++)
      write_values((char *)&samples[j],
        sizeof(samples[j]), output);
      fflush(output);
}
}}}

@parameters

== PipeIn ==

Source:
    Data can be piped in through a UNIX pipe or a Network port.
    
Filename:
    The file that the device data will be read from. The file must
    not be a regular file. It must be a "named pipe" or "FIFO". In
    UNIX, see "mknod".
    
Server Address:
    The network address of the server computer. This address is a
    standard WWW address, such as 'foo' or 'foo.bar.com'.
    
Server Port:
    The network port of the server. The port is a number between
    `5000` and `10000`, which both the server and the client use to
    connect with.
    
Active:
    While active, the CHOP receives information from the pipe or
    server. When off, no updating occurs. Data sent by a server is
    lost, but a pipe will store the data until active is turned on
    again. If in Network mode, turning this parameter on initiates a
    connection, and turning it off breaks the connection.
    
Reset Channels:
    Clears all channels and data.
