= Soft Body Fracture Properties =

"""Defines how a Soft Body Object responds to collisions."""

The Soft Body Fracture Properties DOP defines how a soft body object (e.g., a cloth object) fractures.

@parameters
    
    Enable Fracturing:
        #channels: enablefracturing

        This enables or disables all fracturing for this object.
        
        NOTE:
            Before any fracturing can occur, __Enable Fracturing__ must also be enabled on the [Finite Element Solver|Node:dop/finiteelementsolver].

    Fracture Threshold:
        #channels: fracturethreshold

        This is the amount of relative stretch that will cause the geometry to break up into separate parts during the simulation. For example, if the threshold is set to 0.1, then the geometry may break in places where there is more than 10% stretch compared to the rest geometry.

        Realistic solid objects are not equally strong everywhere, there are weak parts that tend to fracture before any other parts. To create these relatively weaker parts you can create a vertex attribute called fracturethreshold. This attribute is a multiplier for the __Fracture Threshold__ parameter, so that you can still use the __Fracture Threshold__ to control the overall strength of the object.
