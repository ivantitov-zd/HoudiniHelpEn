"""Modify input channels by using expressions."""

This CHOP allows you to modify input channels by using expressions. Up
to six expressions are available. Each input channel is modified by
exactly one expression, and the expressions are looped for multiple
channels.

The output is the same length and set of channels as the first input,
but its sample values are changed according to the expressions.

An expression is applied to each keyframe value or raw sample. There are
up to six expressions. If there are more channels coming from input 0,
the expressions are recycled. A repeat parameter controls how many
channels to apply the first expression to before going on to the second
expression.

The power of this CHOP extends when using special expression functions
to access the other input CHOPs: ic(input#, channel#, index) This gets
the value at the specified index of the specified channel of the
specified input CHOP (all 0-relative). Others include:

* [ic|Exp:ic]() can use local variables: `$C` (channel #), `$I` (index).

* [oc|Exp:oc](`chan`_`idx`, `samp_idx`) gets at the output CHOP's samples as
  they are being built. Like in calculus integration, you need a value
  from the previous output sample to generate the next one.

* [ics|Exp:ics](input#) gets the start index of any input CHOP. similar
  for `ice()` and `icl()`.

* [icr|Exp:icr]() gives the sample rate.

This CHOP has Sample Rate Match options in the Common page.


@parameters

    == Group ==

        Channels Per Expr:
            #channels: /chanexpr

            The number of channels that use the current expression
            before the next expression is selected.
        Num Expressions:
            #channels: /numexpr

            The total number of expressions that are defined.

    == Expr ==

        Expression 1-6:
            #channels: /expr0-expr5

            The expressions.
            
[Include:common#common]

@locals

    V:
        The current value.
        
    I:
        The current index.
        
    C:
        The current channel (0 to NC-1). With this variable, channels
        can be shifted relative to one another.
    NC:
        The total number of channels.
