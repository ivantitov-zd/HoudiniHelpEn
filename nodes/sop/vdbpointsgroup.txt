= VDB Points Group =

"""Manipulates the Internal Groups of a VDB Points Primitive."""

The VDB Points Group SOP acts as a Group SOP for the points inside
of a VDB Points primitive.  It can create an manipulate these internal
groups.  The generated group can then be used to selectively unpack
a subset of the points in a later [Convert VDB Points|Node:sop/convertvdbpoints].

@parameters
