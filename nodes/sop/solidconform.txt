= Solid Conform =

"""Creates a tetrahedral mesh that conforms to a connected mesh as much as possible."""

The Solid Conform SOP creates a tetrahedral mesh that largely conforms to the input mesh.  This means that the surface of the tetrahedral mesh conforms to the original
surface wherever possible.  In places where the input mesh intersects itself, the tetrahedral mesh may not exactly conform to the input triangles and further processing may
be required to remove extraneous tetrahedra, however these cases are extremely rare.

TIP:
    Use this SOP instead of the Tetrahedralize SOP to convert surface meshes into solid tetrahedralizations.

@parameters

High Quality:
    If disabled, this option produces the simplest tetrahedralization of the input.  If enabled, the tetrahedralization is refined exposing the sizing parameters below. 


== Sizing ==
    The following parameters control the sizes of generated tetrahedra.  Each scale is multiplied by the __Base Size__, which can be specified manually or computed
    automatically.

    Base Size:
        If enabled, this option sets the size of the model in the input. This enables the modification of the model without changing the relative scale of the generated tets. If disbaled, the base size of the model is determined automatically as the diameter.  In this mode, the sizes of generated tets are independent of the global scale of the model. All sizing parameters below as scaled using the manually set or automatically computed Base Size.

    Max Tet Scale:
        This parameter controls the maximum size of individual generated tets.  The volume of a regular tetrahedron with side length equal to __Max Tet Size__ sets the maximum volume of resultant tetrahedra.
    
    Local Scaling:
        Selects the method to control sizes of tetrahedra on the surface of the resulting tetrahedralization. Interior tetrahedra are sized based on sizes interpolated from the surface.

        None:
            Surface tetrahedra will not be scaled in any particular way.
        Use Local Feature Size:
            Determine the sizes of surface tetrahedra by following the sizes of triangles in the input.
        Use Point Attribute:
            Specify a custom point attribute to guide the sizes of generated tetrahedra.
        Use Constant:
            Set a constant size to surface tetrahedra.

    Local Feature Scale:
        Sets the scale of local features to guide how large tetrahedra should be on the surface. This is the only scale that isn't multiplied by the __Base Size__ because it scales an already relative quantity -- the feature size.
    
    Local Scale Attribute:
        Sets the scale of surface tetrahedra based on the values of the given point attribute.

    Local Scale Constant:
        Sets the scale of surface tetrahedra to be this constant.
            
    NOTE:
        All scales above except __Local Feature Scale__ are multiplied by the __Base Size__ to give the actual size of tetrahedra.

== Other Parameters ==

    Output Surface Triangles:
        Output surface triangles along with the tetrahedra.

    Allow Surface Modifications:
        Allow for the tetrahedralization add points on the surface to subdivide input polygons.

    Use SDF for Cavity Filling:
        This parameter uses an underlying SDF voxlization of the input mesh to guide which parts of the tetrahedral mesh are to be considered interior. The underlying SDF is eroded by one voxel, so it doesn't affect how the tet mesh conforms to the surface -- only the interior of the mesh i corrected by the SDF.  This option is particularly useful when the input mesh contains small cavities that should be filled with tets. For instance, if an input character model that has a small opening in the mouth, without this option the mouth may be missing tetrahedrons. Use this option to close subtle holes in the mesh.

    Voxel Size:
        This parameter sets the voxel size of the underlying SDF used to determine the inside and outside of the solid represented by the input mesh. A lower value will produce a better approximation at a performance cost.

    Show Self-Intersections:
        Adds a red color to points showing where the input mesh intersected itself.  Use this as a guide to manually remove self-intersections from the input, which will improve the resulting tetrahedralization.
