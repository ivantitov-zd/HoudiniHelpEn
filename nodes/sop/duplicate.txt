"""Copies geometry and applies transformations to the copies."""

The Duplicate OP is a simpler but faster version of
the [Copy node|Node:sop/copy]:

* Copying onto a template is not supported.

* Copies are appended to the source geometry, not extracted.

* Duplicate is much faster than Copy because it's less complex.

@parameters

Source Group:
    A subset of input primitives to copy from.

Number of copies:
    #id: ncy

    The number of copies to be made.

Transform Cumulative:
    Each copy is transformed relative to the previous.

Transform Order:
    Order transformations occur.

Rotate Order:
    Order rotations occur.

Translate:
    #id: t

    Translation along xyz axes.

Rotate:
    #id: r
    
    Rotation about xyz axes.

Scale:
    #id: s

    Non-uniform scaling along xyz axes.

Shear:
    Amount of shearing. The three values represent X on XY plane, X
    on XZ plane, and Y on YZ plane respectively.

Pivot:
    #id: p

    The local pivot point of the copy.

Uniform Scale:
    #id: scale

    Uniform scaling.

Preserve Normal Length:
    Normals to maintain length after transformations.

Create Output Groups:
    Places each copy into a primitive group.

Preserve Groups:
    Don't delete the contents of the copy group if it already exists
    before adding the copied primitives.

Copy Groups:
    The name of the group to create for each copy.

@locals

CY:
    The copy number.

NCY:
    The number of copies.
    
The following variables refer to the input geometry.
    
CEX, CEY, CEZ:
    The centroid of the entire input geometry.

GCX, GCY, GCZ:
    The centroid of the input group.

XMIN, XMAX:
    The X extents of the bounding box of the geometry.

YMIN, YMAX:
    The Y extents of the bounding box of the geometry.

ZMIN, ZMAX:
    The Z extents of the bounding box of the geometry.

SIZEX, SIZEY, SIZEZ:
    The size of the bounding box.

BBX, BBY, BBZ:
    The point's relative position in the bounding box.
