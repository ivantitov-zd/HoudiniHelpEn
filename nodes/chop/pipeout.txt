= Pipe Out =

"""Transmit data out of Houdini to other processes."""

This CHOP can be used to transmit data out of Houdini to other
processes. It can transmit data to a process on the same machine using a
UNIX pipe, or it can transmit data to a process running on a remote
machine using a network connection. If the other process is another
Houdini process, a [Pipe In CHOP|pipein] in that process can be used to receive
the data.

For more information on how to connect two Houdini processes running on
different machines with a [Pipe In|pipein] and Pipe Out CHOP, see the [Pipe In
CHOP|Node:chop/pipein].


@parameters

    == Pipe Out ==

        Destination:
            Data can be transmitted through a pipe or a network
            connection.
        Filename:
            The filename of the pipe to create and send data through.
        Network Port:
            The network port to use. Ports between `5000` and `10000` are
            available for use.
        Active:
            When active, data is sent.
        Send Current Sample:
            If on, only send the current sample. If off, Only all data
            between this frame and the last frame is sent.
        Single Sample:
            In single sample mode, this parameter determines which
            sample to send; the sample at frame `1` or the current
            sample.
        Send All Data:
            Sends all the channel names and their data in one burst.
