"""A microsolver that seeds marker particles around the boundary of a surface."""

The Gas Seed Markers DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Seed Markers DOP creates marker particles, or surfels, along
the boundary of a signed distance field. These can be used to correct a
fluid solution to help preserve volume and maintain high detail on
boundaries.

The created surfels have the `Cd` attribute which signifies if they are
inside or outside surfels. Inside surfels are red, outside are green.
They also have a `pscale` attribute which provides their distance to the
surface clamped to between 0.1 and 0.5 of the voxel size.


@parameters
Surfels:
    The geometry data which will have surfels added to it. Any
    existing surfels will be taken into account in the ensuing
    update. Surfels that are too far outside will be deleted and
    voxels with too few surfels will have additional ones added.
Surfels Group:
    An optional point group to specify which surfels to
    consider when counting existing surfels within a voxel.
Surface:
    The signed distance field to seed the marker surfels around.
    The zero isocontour and an approximately three cell distance on
    other side of it will be seeded with surfels.
Collision Field:
    A signed distance field representing collision geometry. Any
    inside surfel that is inside this field will be deleted.
Source Field:
    A signed distance field representing a fluid source. Any
    outside surfel that is inside this field will be deleted.
Source Velocity:
    A velocity field representing the velocity of a fluid source.
    Surfels inside of the source volume will have the velocities
    overwritten by this field.
Apply Only To New Surfels:
    Apply the __Source Velocity__ field only to the newly created
    surfels inside of the source volume.
Sink Field:
    A signed distance field representing a fluid sink. Any inside
    surfel inside this sink will be deleted.
Boundary Layer Field:
    A signed distance field representing the surface in the 
    boundary layer. Surfels above the surface in the boundary 
    layer will be deleted and voxels with too few surfels will
    have additional ones added.
Boundary Velocity Field:
    A vector field representing the velocity field in the boundary
    layer. Surfels in the boundary layer will have their velocity
    overwritten by this velocity field.
Particle Velocity Attribute:
    The boundary velocity will be applied to the indicated
    attribute for all the surfels.
Slice Index Field:
    An index field that indicates the slice number that a region of a
    simulation corresponds to. If an index field voxel does not match 
    the slice number, a surfel will not be created.
    
    NOTE:
        This index field is only used in the boundary layer. 
Surfels Per Voxel:
    The number of surfels per voxel cell. Surfels will be added to
    cells within the bandwidth until this number is reached.
Birth Threshold:
    Surfels will be added to a voxel once the current number drops
    below the product of this parameter and __Surfels Per Voxel__.
Death Threshold:
    Surfels will be deleted from a voxel once the current number rises
    above the product of this parameter and __Surfels Per Voxel__.
Surface Oversampling:
    Oversample surfels by this multiple when within __Oversampling Bandwidth__
    of the surface.
Oversampling Bandwidth:
    Oversample within this number of voxels from the surface or any __Surface__
    volume boundaries, if __Oversample at Boundaries__ is enabled.
Oversample At Boundaries:
    Oversample within __Oversampling Bandwidth__ voxels of the boundaries of
    the __Surface__ volume.
Move To Isosurface:
    Move surfels that are slightly inside or outside the __Surface__ field back
    to the zero isosurface.
Build Inside Surfels:
    Construct marker surfels on the inside of the surface. Inside
    surfels increase volume as they correct the surface by pushing
    out the boundary.
Build Outside Surfels:
    Construct marker surfels on the outside of the surface. Outside
    surfels decrease volume as they correct the surface by pushing
    in the boundary.
Add Particle System:
    Create a particle system in the __Surfels__ geometry if one does
    not exist.
Kill Outside Bounding Box:
    Kill any surfels outside the bounding box of the field specified in
    the __Surface__ parameter.
Copy Nearest Surfel:
    Instead of explicitly setting the `Cd` and `pscale` attributes when
    creating a new surfel, create a copy of the nearest existing surfel,
    including all other attributes.
Use Boundary:
    Activate the boundary layer option to seed particles inside the layer
    even if there is no surface. Additionally, particles inside the boundary
    layer but above the boundary volume will be deleted.
Lower Border:
    The thickness of the boundary layer into the simulation from the 
    bottom corner.
Upper Border:
    The thickness of the boundary layer into the simulation from the
    upper corner.
Volume Size:
    The size of the current simulation volume. This is used to help determine
    where the boundary layer is positioned in the simulation.
Volume Center:
    The center position of the current simulation volume. This is used to help
    determine where the boundary layer is positioned in the simulation.
Interpolate Velocity In Boundary:
    By default, when new surfels are created in the boundary layer, they will be
    assigned the default velocity (or sampled from the Boundary Velocity Field). 
    With this toggle enable, the new boundary surfels will instead interpolate
    the velocity vector from nearby surfels. This option is useful for maintaining
    water level of a flat tank by freely allow surfels to flow out of the boundary
    layer and into the simulation.
Use Waterline:
    The waterline option replaces the __Boundary Layer Field__ with a plane, where
    particles are instead seeded into volume below the waterline plane and inside
    the boundary layer.
Waterline:
    The __Waterline__ level and __Waterline Direction__ define the waterline plane.
    The volume inside the boundary layer and below the __Waterline__ plane will be
    seeded with particles. Alternatively particles inside the boundary layer and
    above the __Waterline__ plane will be deleted.
Waterline Direction:
    The __Waterline Direction__ specifies the "up" direction of the __Waterline__ plane.
Use pscale Attribute:
    This toggle determines whether the surfel radius used to reseed at the 
    boundary surface is derived from the `pscale` attribute or the user-provided
    value below.
Boundary Surface Offset:
    When reseeding the boundary layer, the surfels will be offset from the surface
    based on this radius. The default is 0, meaning the surfels will be placed exactly
    on the surface.
Interpolation Attributes:
    All attributes matching this pattern will be interpolated to newly
    seeded particles from the surrounding existing particles.  This interpolation
    is more expensive but yields a smoother particle sampling for attributes like
    velocity.
Minimum Radius:
    Surfel's radius will not be smaller than this.  They will
    created this distance from the surface.  This is measured in
    terms of voxel cells.
Maximum Radius:
    Surfel's radius will not be larger than this.  Even if they
    are farther from the surface than this distance, their radius
    will be clamped to this size.  This is measured in terms of
    voxel cells.
Use Bandwidth:
    Use the bandwidth settings to limit the size of the surface boundary
    within which surfels can be created.
Birth Bandwidth:
    Surfels will be created up to this number of cells from the surface if the current number of surfels in the cell is less than surfels per voxel.
Death Bandwidth:
    Surfels will be deleted when they stray this number of cells from the surface boundary.
Seed:
    The seed to the random number generator that determines the position of the newly create surfels or which
    surfel to delete in an overfilled voxel.
Slice Number:
    If non-negative, only particles from this slice will be eligible as seeds.  This avoids wastefully seeding particles in external slices that will be eliminated in the next border update.  This only takes effect if the `slice` attribute is present and __Copy Nearest Surfel__ mode is turned on (and an index field is provided for the boundary layer).
