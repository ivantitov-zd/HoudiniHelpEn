"""The Voice Split CHOP takes an audio track and separates "words" out
into different channels."""

The Voice Split CHOP takes an audio track and separates "words" out into
different channels. A word is defined as audio volume above the silence
level for a certain period of time, followed by a period of silence. The
name of each channel is specified by the __Channel Names__ parameter.

This CHOP is normally used in conjunction with the VoiceSync CHOP to
create a phoneme set. Phonemes are recorded in one audio track with
pauses between each phoneme. This CHOP separates the phonemes into
channels, and allows each phoneme to be named.


@parameters

== Voice Split ==

    Silence Level:
        #channels: /sillevel

        Any audio below this level is considered silence, otherwise it
        is considered to be a word.
    Min Pause Length:
        #channels: /minpause

        The minimum amount of time that the audio must be silent for a
        pause to be detected.
    Min Word Length:
        #channels: /minword

        The minimum length of a word.
    Channel Names:
        #channels: /names

        The names of the channels created from the audio track(s). If
        there are more extracted words than names, names will be
        recycled and incremented (ie. word, word1, word2, etc).
