"""A microsolver that rebuilds fields to match in size and resolution
to a reference field."""

The Gas Match Field DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Match Field DOP creates, resizes, and resamples as necessary
to ensure the data matching the given name exists as a field of the
same resolution and size as the reference field.

This DOP is very useful for creating adhoc fields that you need for
intermediate results but don't want to explicitly attach with the
Scalar Field DOP.  If you want to remove the adhoc field when done,
you can zero it out.  Constant fields are compressed so do not have
the memory footprint of a varying field.

NOTE:
    If the field's size or resolution changes as a result of the 
    matching, its data is reset to 0.

TIP:
    If you want to visualize the resulting field, you can add the appropriate
    Scalar/Vector/Matrix/Index Field Visualization node as an input to the gas
    match field.  This visualization data will then be attached as subdata to
    all the created fields.  However, to visualize the fields separately you
    will need to use multiple match field operators.

@parameters
    Field:
	The name of a field that one wants to create.  If it doesn't
	exist, one will be created.  This can be a space separated
	list of fields to create many fields in one DOP.
    Reference Field:
	The comparison field for determining the size and resolution.
    Reference SOP:
	    Instead of matching to a field on your object, you can also match with a volume defined in SOPs.  Similar to the [SOP Scalar Field|Node:dop/sopscalarfield] and [SOP Vector Field|Node:dop/sopvectorfield] DOPs, rotated and tapered volumes will not be properly detected.  
        NOTE:
            The SOP network referenced should not try to read data from this DOP network, but be able to cook independently.
    Rank:
	Controls the type of field created.  The type of Field does
	not have to match that of the Reference Field.  A __Scalar__
	field could be created to match a __Vector__ field, for
	example.  If the reference is a SOP, __Scalar__ field is always
	assumed.
    Match Samples:
	If the type of the destination field is the same as the
	reference field, one can do more than just ensure that the
	resolution is the same.  One can also ensure that the sampling
	pattern (ie, center, edges, corners) matches between the
	fields.
