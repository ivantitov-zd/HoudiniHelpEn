"""Creates a simulated Finite Element solid from geometry."""

== Overview ==

The Solid Object DOP creates a Solid Object inside the DOP simulation. It creates a new object and attaches the subdata required for it to be a properly conforming Solid Object. Solid Objects can be simulated using the Finite Element Solver.

Solid objects are different than rigid bodies. Solid objects are flexible, which makes it possible for them to deform, and can be used to simulate materials such as flesh, wood, and concrete. Solid objects are also able to break dynamically during a simulation, based on the deformation that happens during the simulation.

You can use a tetrahedral mesh in SOPs to create your solid object. Your solid geometry should satisfy [guidelines|/finiteelements/geometry] that ensure a fast-running and good looking simulation.

See [the section on solid simulation|/finiteelements/] for more information.


== How to ==

:task: Create a hard solid object:
    # Select the geometry to convert to an organic mass.
    # On the __Solid__ tab, click the [Icon:DOP/solidobject] Solid Object tool.

:task: Create a squishy solid object:
    # Select the geometry to convert to an organic mass.
    # On the __Solid__ tab, click the [Icon:SHELF/squid] Organic Mass tool.

NOTE:
    Once you convert geometry to a solid object, you can only transform, rotate, and scale it at the first frame.
