"""Filters an audio clip, and then applies other audio effects."""

This CHOP filters an audio clip, and then applies other audio effects.
The functions, in the order they are applied, are:

* *Parametric Filter* - Filters any frequency range of the input.

* *Sideband Filter* - Filters the input with another audio channel's
  power spectrum (contained in the second input).

* *Pitch Shift* - Shifts the pitch of an audio clip, maintaining the
  same duration.

* *Echo Generator* - Adds echoes to the audio clip.

This CHOP may be time sliced to filter audio in realtime, though pitch
shifting is not available in time slice mode.

Starred parameters (*) may be animated by the third input. These
animation channels must be named the same as the control channel names.


@parameters

    == Filter ==

        Center Frequency*:
            #channels: /center

            The center frequency of the filter.
        Bandwidth*:
            #channels: /bandwidth

            The bandwidth of the filter, in octaves.
        Filter Gain*:
            #channels: /filtergain

            The audio in the frequency range of the filter is multiplied
            by the Filter Gain.
        Pass Gain*:
            #channels: /passgain

            The audio outside the frequency range of the filter is
            multiplied by the Pass Gain.
        Filter Shape*:
            #channels: /shape

            The shape of the filter. Zero is box, `.5` is triangular and `1`
            is Gaussian.
        Filter Dropoff*:
            #channels: /dropoff

            The dropoff factor of the filter shape.

    == Sideband ==

        Sideband Filter:
            Method to use when sideband filtering.
        Filter Type:
            The power spectrum of a sideband filter can be used to
            enhance frequencies (Sideband Pass) or remove them (Sideband
            Stop).
        Sideband Gain:
            #channels: /sidegain

            The gain of the sideband filter.
        Base Gain:
            #channels: /sidebasegain

            The base gain of the channel.
        Sideband Effect:
            #channels: /sideeffect

            The frequency effect of the filter.

    == Pitch ==

        Octave Shift*:
            #channels: /pitchshift

            Shifts the audio pitch up or down, expressed in octaves.
        Pitch Chunk:
            #channels: /pitchchunk

            The chunk size at which __Octave Shift__ resamples. Used to fine
            tune the sound once the correct pitch is found.

    == Echo ==

        Pre Echoes:
            #channels: /prenum

            The number of echoes to generate before the sound occurs
            (not natural).
        Pre Echo Delay:
            #channels: /predelay

            The amount of time between echoes.
        Pre Echo Dropoff:
            #channels: /predrop

            The strength of the audio volume of the first pre-echo
            (other pre-echoes reduce by the same factor).
        Post Echoes:
            #channels: /postnum

            The number of echoes to generate after the sound has
            occurred.
        Post Echo Delay:
            #channels: /postdelay

            Same as Pre Echo Delay.
        Post Echo Dropoff:
            #channels: /postdrop

            Same as Pre Echo Dropoff.
        Remainder:
            See Remainder parameter in Copy or Trigger CHOPs.

    == Digital ==

        Filter Chunk:
            Number of samples of input to process at a time for
            parametric and sideband filters.
        Chunk Overlap:
            #channels: /overlap

            The amount to overlap the chunks.
        Chunk Discard:
            #channels: /discard

            The amount of the chunk to discard.
            
[Include:common#common]

    I:
        The current index.
    C:
        The current channel (0 to NC-1).
