"""Lets you interactively draw a reduced quad mesh automatically snapped to existing geometry."""


== Overview ==

:vimeo: TopoBuild
    #id: 142306098

This node is useful when you have a very high-resolution model and want to create a much lower-resolution model from it. You can draw the quads of the new mesh by hand, automatically snapping the corners to the existing surface.

== Toolbar ==

When this node is active, the operation toolbar across the top of the 3D view has controls that change the way the tool works in the viewport. See [How to use the node|#how] below for more information.

:action:[Icon:BUTTONS/topobuild_build] [Build|#build]:
    #id: build
    #hotkeys: Shift + 1
    
    Switch to the [Build|#build] sub-tool.
    This lets you create and edit polygons by placing points on the reference surface. 

:action:[Icon:BUTTONS/editstate_slide] [Slide|#slide]:
    #id: slide
    #hotkeys: Shift + 2
    
    Switch to the Slide sub-tool.
    This moves points/edges in the new surface across the reference surface.

:action:[Icon:BUTTONS/cut] [Cut|#cut]:
    #id: split
    #hotkeys: Shift + 3
    
    Switch to the Cut sub-tool.
    This lets you cut through polygons by drawing lines.

:action:[Icon:BUTTONS/topobuild_brush][Brush|#brush]:
    #id: brush
    #hotkeys: Shift + 4
    
    Switch to the Brush sub-tool.
    This lets you move points by brushing over them.

:action:[Icon:BUTTONS/smooth] [Smooth|#brush]:
    #id: smooth
    #hotkeys: Shift + 5
    
    Switch to the Smooth sub-tool.
    This lets you relax points by brushing over them.

:action:[Icon:BUTTONS/topobuild_skin] [Skin|#skin]:
    #id: skin
    #hotkeys: Shift + 6
    
    Switch to the Skin sub-tool.
    Build "sleeves" of polygons by defining profile curves and a seam.

Slide mode:
    #id: mode
    
    When using the Slide sub-tool, you can set this to control how to slide edges between adjacent rows/columns.

    Anchored blend:
        Blends the original shape of the edge selection with an interpolation between the adjacent edges.

    Blend:
        Only blends between the shapes of the adjacent edges, doesn't retain the original shape of the edge selection at all.

    Match Profile:
        Maintains a fixed distance from one of the adjacent edges.

    Match Opposite Profile:
        Same as "Match Profile" but maintains a fixed distance from the _other_ adjacent edge.

    Uniform Distance:
        Moves the edge selection a fixed distance from its original position, without regard to adjacent edges.

Opacity:
    Changes how much brushing affects the points.

Smooth All:
    When using the Smooth sub-tool, click this to smooth all points.

Edge snap:
    When using the Cut sub-tool, snap to existing edges. This makes it easier to cut across polygons.

Divisions/Spans:
    When using the Skin sub-tool, controls how many rows and columns to add between cross-sections.


== How to == (how)

:task:Start using the tool:
    # Select the geometry you want to use as the template.
    
    # On the __Model__ shelf, click [Icon:SOP/topobuild] Topo Build.
    
        The tool creates a new [Geometry object|Node:obj/geo] for the new surface. It imports the selected surface into the new object.
    
    # Click four points on the template surface to create the first face.

:task:Set up the viewport:
    * You can use a [visualizer|/basics/visualizers] to color the original surface to make it easier to distinguish the new surface.

    * Change your [shading mode|/basics/view] to __Hidden Line Ghost__ to get a better view of the new surface.

    * Hide the [construction plane|/model/aids] to get a better view of the new surface's edges.


== [Icon:BUTTONS/topobuild_build] Build == (build)

:task:Draw new quads:
    # Click an existing point to start drawing a new quad.
    
    # Click the other three corners to finish the new quad.
    
        Drawing automatically snaps to existing points.

:task:Extend edges:
    * Click an edge to start creating new faces from the edge.
    
    * You can click multiple times to create a strip of new quads.
    
    * You can ((Shift))-drag to scale or ((Ctrl))-drag to rotate the edges before you click to place them.
    
    * Press ((Esc)) or click ((MMB)) to stop adding.

:task:Create free points to snap to:
    Click outside existing quads.

:task:Select points/edges:
    * To select a free point, click it.
    
    * To select a point that's part of a quad, click it and then press ((Esc)) to cancel drawing.
    
    * To select an edge, click it and then press ((Esc)) to cancel extending. You can use [edge loop selection|/basics/select#edges].
    
    * To select additional points/edges, hold ((Shift)) and click them.

:task:Move existing points/edges:
    * Drag existing points or edges to move them across the template surface.
    
    * You can drag points onto other points to fuse them.
    
:task:Temporarily disable snapping:
    Hold ((Ctrl)) and click to disable automatically snapping to existing points.

:task: Delete all free points:
    Press ((Shift + Del)).

:action:Collapse to point:
    #id: collapse
    #hotkeys: Shift + X
    
    Replaces the selected faces or edges with a single point (in Topobuild tool's Build mode).

:action:Make circle:
    #id: circle
    #hotkeys: Shift + C
    
    Bends the outer edges of the selection into a circle.

:action:Space out selection:
    #id: spacing
    #hotkeys: Shift + E
    
    Tries to move the selected edges to be spaced equally apart (in Topobuild tool's Build mode).

== [Icon:BUTTONS/editstate_slide] Slide == (slide)

The slide sub-tool is similar to the slide mode in the [Edit node|Node:sop/edit]. It lets you select and slide edge columns/rows across the reference surface.

Use [the Slide Mode menu|#mode] to control how the sliding edges interact with the adjacent edges.


== [Icon:BUTTONS/cut] Cut == (cut)

:task:Split existing polygons:
    # Select the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/cut] Cut sub-tool.
    
    # Click a point or an edge to start the cut.
    
        You can use the __Edge division__ controls in the toolbar to set up snapping points along edges. You can increase or decrease the number of snapping points using the ((mouse_wheel)) mouse wheel.
    
    # Move the mouse to draw the line to cut.
        
        You can cut across multiple polygons at once.
        
        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/topobuild_cut.png]
    
    # Click to cut, or press ((Esc)) to cancel.
    
        You don't have to click a point or edge to cut. If you click off an edge, the tool make any valid (yellow) cuts along the line and ignore invalid (magenta) cuts.

:task:Insert edge loops:
    # Select the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/cut] Cut sub-tool.
    
    # Hold ((Shift)) and click an edge.
    
        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/topobuild_insert_loop.png]
    
        You can use the __Edge division__ controls in the toolbar or the ((mouse_wheel)) mouse wheel to change the number of edge loops inserted.
        
        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/topobuild_insert_multiloop.png]
    
    Inserting edge loops only works on quads. The tool will ignore polygons with more or less than four sides.


== [Icon:BUTTONS/topobuild_brush] Brush and [Icon:BUTTONS/smooth] Smooth == (brush)

:fig:[Image:/images/nodes/sop/topobuild_brush.png]
    * Drag ((Shift + LMB)) to change the size of the brush.

    * Use the __Opacity__ setting in the toolbar to control how much the brush affects the points.

:task:Brush points across the surface:
    # Select the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/topobuild_brush] Brush sub-tool.
    
    # Brush across points to move them. The points stay on the reference surface as they move.

:task:Smooth point positions by brushing:
    # Select the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/smooth] Smooth sub-tool.
    
    # Brush across points to relax their positions. The points stay on the reference surface as they move.

:task:Smooth all point positions:
    # Select the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/smooth] Smooth sub-tool.

    # Press the __Smooth All__ button in the toolbar.  The points stay on the reference surface as they move.

    Use the __Opacity__ setting in the toolbar to control how much the operation affects the points.


== [Icon:BUTTONS/topobuild_skin] Skin == (skin)

This sub-tool is useful for building quasi-cylindrical features around the reference surface, for example around a dinosaur's tail. *This tool does not support areas with holes*.

:video:
    #src: /videos/topobuild_skinning.mp4

:task:Build a polygon "sleeve" around the reference surface:
    # Select the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/topobuild_skin] Skin sub-tool.
    
        TIP:
            If you select an unshared edge and then click the Skin sub-tool, the tool will start the new skinned surface from the selected edge.

    # Position the view so you're looking at the reference surface side-on.
    
    # Drag ((LMB)) to draw "cross-section" lines across the feature. The tool will turn these into edge loops in the generated surface.
    
        While creating cross-sections you can select and edit cross-sections you've already drawn:
        
        * Hold ((Shift)) and box-select one or more cross-sections.
        
        * Press ((Del)) to clear the selected cross-section(s).
        
        * Hold ((B)) and drag to move the selected cross-section(s) along the reference surface.
        
        * Press ((Shift + D)) to add new cross-sections between the selected cross-sections.
        
        * Press ((Shift + A)) to align the selected cross-section(s) with the reference geometry.
        
    # To generate a surface, hold ((Ctrl)) and drag _across_ the cross-sections (for example, along the length of the tail) to define the "spine" of the feature. The tool uses this free-form line to create a seam along the generated surface.
    
        * You can continue to add and edit the cross sections after drawing the seam and generating the surface.
        
        * To change the intersection point of the seam with a cross-section, hold ((Ctrl)) and drag over just that cross section again at a different point.
    
    # Use the __Spans__ option in the operations toolbar (at the top of the viewer), or roll ((mouse_wheel)) to set the number of divisions around the sleeve.
    
    # Press ((Enter)), or select another tool to finish editing the sleeve surface.
    
        Once you exit the Skin sub-tool, you can no longer go back and edit the cross-sections or seam. You can use the other tools to edit the generated polygons, or undo to get back to the editing mode.

:action:Align cross sections:
    #id: skinalign
    #hotkeys: Shift + A
    
    Align any selected cross-sections perpendicular to the seam (in Topobuild tool's Skin mode).

:action:Translate cross sections:
    #id: skintranslate
    #hotkeys: B
    
    Hold this key and drag to move selected cross-sections while using the Skin mode.
