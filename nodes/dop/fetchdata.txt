= Fetch Data =

"""Fetches a piece of data from a simulation object."""

This node fetches a piece of data from a simulation object so that it
can be modified or attached to some other object.

The output data can be given a different name from the input data. You
can reattach the renamed data to the original source object using an
Apply Data DOP, thereby making a copy of an existing piece of data.

The number of objects on the input is irrelevant to the evaluation of
this node. Only one of the input objects will be used as the source for
the data.


@parameters
    Activation:
        Data is only extracted from the source object if the activation
        parameter is non-zero. 

	The activation parameter supports object
        specific local variables, but note that the variables are
        evaluated for the object to which the output data is being
        attached. The variables are not evaluated for the source object.
    Source Object:
        The object from which to fetch the data.

        You can use group names, object names, object ids, and/or
        wildcard characters to match an object, and the negation
        character (`^`) to eliminate objects from consideration. If
        multiple objects match, Houdini uses the one with the lowest
        object ID as the source object.

    Source Data Name:
        Data matching the Source Data Name will be extracted from the
        source object and provided as the output to this node.
    Data Name:
        Houdini renames the fetched data to the Data Name.
        A new name lets you re-apply the data to the original object,
        thereby copying subdata.

        If this field is blank, the Source Data name is used.

@inputs
    First:
        One, and only one, of the objects connected to this input is
        the source from which the data is fetched. Use the __Source
        object__ parameter to choose which object to fetch data from.
@outputs
    First:
        The data fetched from the input object.
@locals
    [Include:standard_locals]
