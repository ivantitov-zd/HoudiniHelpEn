= POP Awaken =

"""A POP node that resets the stopped attribute on particles, waking them up."""

Particles with the `stopped` attribute set to `1` are considered asleep
and stop moving.  This nodes provides tools to modify this, either
from existing volume fields or by the particles themselves.

This operator modifies the `stopped` attribute.

@parameters

[Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

== Volume Awaken ==

Awaken by Volume:
	Awakens or puts to sleep particles that enter the active area of a volume.  The volume is usually built in SOPs and maybe an SDF or a Fog volume.

[Include:standard_pop_parms#geoSourceParms/]

Action:
	Whether particles that meet the volume criteria are put to sleep or awoken.  Particles not meeting the criteria are left unchanged.

When Volume Is:
	The volume is sampled at the particle location.  The resulting value is compared with the volume threshold.  This option controls then whether the particle is affected or not.

	To affect particles inside an SDF volume, use Less Than and a Volume Threshold of 0.

	To affect particles inside a fog volume, use Greater Than and a Volume Threshold of 0.5.

Volume Threshold:
	At what volume value the particles start to become affected.

== Self Awaken ==

Awaken by Nearby Particles:
	Often flying particles may reach distant parts of your simulation and require particles there to be awoken.  This option automatically builds a volume out of active, fast moving, particles, and awakens any particles within that volume.

Velocity Threshold:
	How fast particles have to be moving to be eligible for awakening more particles.  If this is too low, you will quickly cascade and awaken the entire world.

Wake up Scale:
	Particles awaken everything within the maximum of their own `pscale`
	radius and the grid spacing.  The wake up scale is multiplied by the
	particles `pscale` attribute to get the influence distance.

Grid Spacing:
	For efficiency the fast moving particles are rasterized into a volume.
	This controls the resolution of that volume.  Since any particle
	in a non-zero grid cell is activated, it also implicitly controls
	the coarseness of the activation pattern.
