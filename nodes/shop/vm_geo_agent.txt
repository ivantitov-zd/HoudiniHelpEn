"""Creates crowds geometry for agent primitives at render time."""

The Agent Procedural is used to create agent geometry for crowds rendering.
By default, this procedural is not necessary because it will automatically be
used by Mantra when rendering agent primitives. However, this is provided for
overriding the default settings that are used for rendering agents.

@parameters

== Main ==

Enable LOD:
    If enabled, an LOD optimization will be used to further share the geometry
    for agents whose pose are very similar.

LOD:
    The threshold at which the LOD optimization will be used. The default value
    of 1.0 means that the optimization will be used when tolerance between the
    agent poses is less than approximately 1 pixel. In practice, you may wish
    to set this to a lower value because the deformed geometry differences
    might still be noticeable depending on the scene. Lower values will make it
    less likely for for the LOD optimization to trigger at the cost of a larger
    rendering memory footprint.

Optimize Exact Instances:
    If enabled, the procedural will search for agents that have identical poses
    and instance their deformed geometry.

== IFD Bounds ==

Bounding Box:    
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the generated
    agent geometry. It's not recommended to be used for this procedural since
    the individual bounding boxes of the individual agents must always be
    computed.

SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
