= Agent Constraint Network =

"""Builds a constraint network to hold an agent's limbs together."""

This node will create a [constraint|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] for each transform in the agent's collision layer that has a shape attached to it.
The rotation limits set up by the [Agent Configure Joints|Node:sop/agentconfigurejoints] node will be used to set up [cone twist constraints|Node:dop/conetwistconrel].
For any transforms where the rotation limits were not set (or if there are multiple root collision shapes), [pin constraints|Node:dop/hardconrel] will be created to prevent the ragdoll from immediately separating.

@parameters

    Group:
        The agents to create constraints for.
    Pin Root Collision Shapes:
        #id: pinrootshapes
        If there are multiple root collision shapes, pin constraints will be created to hold those objects together.
    Pin Shapes With No Rotation Limits:
        #id: pinunconfiguredshapes
        If there is a shape whose joint did not have a rotation limit set, a pin constraint will be created to attach it to its parent.
    Random Seed:
        Seed used when adding random variation to the cone twist constraints' parameters.
    Softness:
        #id: softness
        Once an angle is greater than softness times the maximum angle, the constraint begins to take effect.
        Lowering the value of softness softens the constraint boundaries.
        However, values that are too small can cause a "popping" effect at the start of the simulation for joints that are near their rotation limits and are past the softness threshold.
    Randomness:
        Specifies how much the __Softness__ can be randomly varied by.
    Constraint Force Mixing:
        #id: cfm
        Increase this to make the constraint spongier, and potentially increase the stability of the simulation.
        The constraint may be violated by an amount proportional to the force required to re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
    Randomness:
        Specifies how much the __Constraint Force Mixing__ can be randomly varied by.
    Bias Factor:
        #id: bias
        The rate at which the constraint corrects errors in position or orientation.
        A value of 1 will ensure that the constraint is always obeyed. It is recommended to keep bias between 0.2 and 0.5.
    Randomness:
        Specifies how much the __Bias Factor__ can be randomly varied by.
    Relaxation Factor:
        #id: relaxation
        The rate at which the angular velocity is changed by the constraint.
        A low value means the constraint will modify the velocities slowly, leaving the boundaries appearing softer.
    Randomness:
        Specifies how much the __Relaxation Factor__ can be randomly varied by.

    [Include:/nodes/dop/conetwistconrel#positioncfm]

    Randomness:
        Specifies how much the __Position CFM__ can be randomly varied by.

    [Include:/nodes/dop/conetwistconrel#positionerp]

    Randomness:
        Specifies how much the __Position ERP__ can be randomly varied by.
