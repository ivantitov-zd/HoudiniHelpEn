"""Evaluates the length of an arc on a primitive using parametric uv coordinates."""

:usage: `float primarclen(string geometry; vector2 uv1; vector2 uv2; int prim_num)`

Returns the arc length between two parametric UV coordinates on a given primitive. This lets you measure the distance across a polygon face or along a curve.

[Include:_common#geometry_output]

`uv1`, `uv2`:
    The start and end coordinates in the primitive's parametric space to measure between.

:arg:prim_num:
    The number of the primitive across which to measure the distance.

TIP:
    You can also read the `arclength` primitive intrinsic attribute to get a curve's total arc length.
