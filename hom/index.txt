"""How to script Houdini using Python and the Houdini Object Model."""

== Overview ==

The Houdini Object Model (HOM) is an application programming interface
(API) that lets you get information from and control Houdini using the
[Python scripting language|http://www.python.org/]. HOM replaces the
functionality of Houdini's previous scripting solutions,
the [expression language|/expressions/] and [HScript|/commands/].

In Python, the [hou package|/hom/hou/_index] is the top of a hierarchy of modules, functions, 
and classes that define the HOM. The `hou` module is automatically imported 
when you are writing expressions in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] 
and in the `hython` command-line shell.


== Which Python? ==

:platform:Mac
    On Mac OS X, Houdini uses the system's Python.

:platform:Windows
    On Windows, Houdini uses the version of Python installed with Houdini.

:platform:Linux
    On Linux, Houdini does not look at `$PATH` when trying to search and load the Python library. Instead it searches all the paths in `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, then `/lib`, and then `/usr/lib`. If it can't find a suitable Python library in the system, it uses the one in `$HFS`. If your Python library is not in a standard location, you should add its directory path to `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
