= Cloth Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Cloth Objects to an object."""

The Cloth Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and attaches
the data which is needed for it to be used as a [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject].

This DOP is very similar to the [Cloth Object DOP|Node:dop/clothobject], except it allows you to explicitly control the creation of the object using another DOP, such as the [Empty Object DOP|Node:dop/emptyobject]. This can be used for more advanced instancing or creating objects every 10 frames.

See [cloth forces|/dyno/cloth#forces] and [cloth collisions|/dyno/cloth#collsions]
for more information.
