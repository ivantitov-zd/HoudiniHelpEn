"""A Geometry object contains the points and primitives that define a 3D
geometric shape.  For example, each SOP node in Houdini generates a single
Geometry object."""

If you ask a SOP for its geometry via [Hom:hou.SopNode#geometry], you'll get
a read-only reference to it.  If the SOP recooks, the corresponding Geometry
object will update to the SOP's new geometry.  If the SOP is deleted, accessing
the Geometry object will raise a [Hom:hou.ObjectWasDeleted] exception.  If
you call methods that try to modify the geometry, they will raise a
[Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] exception.

If you do not want the geometry to update when the SOP recooks, you can call
[Hom:hou.Geometry#freeze].  freeze returns another Geometry object that will
not change when the SOP recooks.  Accessing frozen Geometry is slightly faster,
since Houdini does not need to look up the SOP node for each access, so you
may want to use frozen geometry for speed-crucial operations.

If you're writing a SOP using Python, you will have read-write access to
the geometry, and it will be frozen.  To create a Python-defined SOP,
select __File > New Operator Type...__ and place the Python code in the
__Code__ tab.

Finally, you can allocate a new frozen geometry with read-write access by
creating an instance of [Hom:hou.Geometry].


@methods


== Attributes ==

::`findPointAttrib(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.Attrib] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::findPointAttrib
    #replaces: Exp:haspointattrib
    Look up a point attribute by name.  Returns the corresponding
    [Hom:hou.Attrib] object, or None if no attribute exists with that name.

    Note that the point position attribute is named `P` and is 3 floats in
    size.  Also, the point weight attribute is named `Pw` and is 1 float in
    size.  These attributes always exist in HOM, even though they are not
    listed by Houdini's UI.

    See [Hom:hou.Point#attribValue] for an example.

::`findPrimAttrib(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.Attrib] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::findPrimAttrib
    #replaces: Exp:hasprimattrib
    Look up a primitive attribute by name.  Returns the corresponding
    [Hom:hou.Attrib] object, or None if no attribute exists with that name.

::`findVertexAttrib(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.Attrib] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::findVertexAttrib
    #replaces: Exp:hasvertexattrib
    Look up a vertex attribute by name.  Returns the corresponding
    [Hom:hou.Attrib] object, or None if no attribute exists with that name.

::`findGlobalAttrib(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.Attrib] or `None`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::findGlobalAttrib
    #replaces: Exp:hasdetailattrib
    Look up a global (a.k.a. detail) attribute by name.  Returns the
    corresponding [Hom:hou.Attrib] object, or None if no attribute exists with
    that name.

::`pointAttribs(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Attrib]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::pointAttribs
    Return a tuple of all the point attributes.

    Note that the point position attribute is named `P` and is 3 floats in
    size.  Also, the point weight attribute is named `Pw` and is 1 float in
    size.  These attributes always exist in HOM, even though they are not
    listed by Houdini's UI.

::`primAttribs(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Attrib]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::primAttribs
    Return a tuple of all the primitive attributes.

::`vertexAttribs(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Attrib]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::vertexAttribs
    Return a tuple of all the vertex attributes.

::`globalAttribs(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Attrib]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::globalAttribs
    Return a tuple of all the global (a.k.a. detail) attributes.

::`addAttrib(self, type, name, default_value, transform_as_normal=False, create_local_variable=True)` -> [Hom:hou.Attrib]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::addAttrib
    Create a new point, primitive, vertex, or global (a.k.a. detail) attribute.
    Returns a [Hom:hou.Attrib] object describing the newly created attribute.
    You would typically call this method from the code of a Python-defined
    SOP.

    type:
        A [Hom:hou.attribType] value to specify if the new attribute should be
        a point, primitive, vertex, or global attribute.
    name:
        The new attribute's name.  Each attribute in the geometry must have
        a unique name.
    default_value:
        The default value for this attribute.  When an attribute is created,
        all existing elements (e.g. primitives or points) will store this
        value.  As well, elements that you add later will also use this value.

        This value also determines the attribute's data type, and may be one
        of the following:
        - an integer
        - a float
        - a string
        - an integer sequence
        - a float sequence

        If the default value is a sequence of integers or floats, the sequence
        size will determine the attribute's size.  Otherwise, the attribute's
        size is 1.

        String attributes do not support a default value and use this value
        solely for type determination.
    transform_as_normal:
        This parameter may only be set to `True` when the default value is a
        sequence of 3 floats.  For such attributes, Houdini will not modify the
        attribute values when it transforms (translates, rotates, etc.) the
        geometry.  If you want to the attribute to be transformed as a vector
        (such as a normal vector) when Houdini transforms the geometry, set
        this parameter to `True`.
    create_local_variable:
        If `True`, Houdini will create a local variable for this attribute
        that may be used in parameter expressions.  The name of the local
        variable is the attribute's name, all in upper case.  The mapping from
        attribute names to local variables is stored in a special global
        attribute named `"varmap"`.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if an attribute with this name already
    exists.  If you are familiar with the C++ Houdini Development Kit (HDK),
    you know that Houdini can support attributes with the same name but with
    different types.  However, many SOPs do not let you distinguish between
    attributes that have the same name, and multiple attributes with the same
    name are discouraged.  For this reason, you cannot create them with this
    method.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if transform_as_normal is `True` and the
    default value is not a sequence of 3 floats.

    {{{
    #!python
    # Create an integer point attribute of size 1 named "population", and
    # create 5 points with attribute values 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20.  This code
    # will work from inside a Python SOP, but not from the Python shell.
    geo = hou.pwd().geometry()
    population_attrib = geo.addAttrib(hou.attribType.Point, "population", 0)
    for i in range(5):
        point = geo.createPoint()
        point.setPosition((i, 0, 0))
        point.setAttribValue(population_attrib, i * 5)
    }}}

    The following example shows how to copy an existing attribute:
    {{{
    #!python
    def copyAttrib(attrib, new_name):
        return attrib.geometry().addAttrib(
            attrib.type(), new_name, attrib.defaultValue(), attrib.isTransformedAsNormal())
    }}}

    If `create_local_variable` is `True`, this function performs the equivalent
    of the following code:
    {{{
    #!python
    def addLocalVariable(geo, attrib_name):
        '''Create a geometry attribute and add a local variable for it.'''
        # The variable mappings are stored in the varmap attribute's string
        # table.  This table is different than varmap's current value, which
        # simply refers to an entry in that table.  So, to ensure an entry
        # exists in the table, we simply set varmap's value.
        map_value = "%s -> %s" % (attrib_name, attrib_name.upper())
        if geo.findGlobalAttrib("varmap") is None:
            geo.addAttrib(hou.attribType.Global, "varmap", "")
        geo.setGlobalAttribValue("varmap", map_value)
    }}}

::`addArrayAttrib(self, type, name, data_type, tuple_size=1)` -> [Hom:hou.Attrib]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::addArrayAttrib
    Create a new point, primitive, vertex, or global (a.k.a. detail) array 
    attribute. Returns a [Hom:hou.Attrib] object describing the newly created 
    attribute. You would typically call this method from the code of a 
    Python-defined SOP.

    type:
        A [Hom:hou.attribType] value to specify if the new attribute should be
        a point, primitive, vertex, or global attribute.
    name:
        The new attribute's name.  Each attribute in the geometry must have
        a unique name.
    data_type:
        A [Hom:hou.attribData] value to specify if the new attribute should be
        an int, float, or string attribute.
    tuple_size:
        The new attribute's tuple size.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if an attribute with this name already
    exists.  If you are familiar with the C++ Houdini Development Kit (HDK),
    you know that Houdini can support attributes with the same name but with
    different types.  However, many SOPs do not let you distinguish between
    attributes that have the same name, and multiple attributes with the same
    name are discouraged.  For this reason, you cannot create them with this
    method.

::`attribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `int`, `float`, `str`, or `tuple`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::attribValue
    #replaces: Exp:detail, Exp:detailattribsize, Exp:details
    Return the global (a.k.a. detail) attribute value for a particular
    attribute.  The attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib]
    object.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no attribute exists with this name.

::`floatAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::floatAttribValue
    Return the global (a.k.a. detail) attribute value for a particular floating
    point attribute.  The attribute may be specified by name or by
    [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no attribute exists with this name
    or the attribute is not a float of size 1.

    In most cases, you'll just use [Hom:hou.Geometry#attribValue] to access
    attribute values.  Houdini uses this method internally to implement
    attribValue.

::`floatListAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `tuple` of `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::floatListAttribValue
    Return the global (a.k.a. detail) attribute value for a particular floating
    point attribute.  The attribute may be specified by name or by
    [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.  The return value is a list of floats.

    It is valid to call this method when the attribute's size is 1.  In this
    case, a list with one element is returned.

    See also:
    - [Hom:hou.Geometry#attribValue]

::`intAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::intAttribValue
    Return the global (a.k.a. detail) attribute value for a particular integer
    attribute of size 1.  The attribute may be specified by name or by
    [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.  See [Hom:hou.Geometry#floatAttribValue] for more
    information.

::`intListAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `tuple` of `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::intListAttribValue
    Return the global (a.k.a. detail) attribute value for a particular integer
    attribute.  The attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib]
    object.  The return value is a list of ints.  See
    [Hom:hou.Geometry#floatListAttribValue] for more information.

::`stringAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::stringAttribValue
    Return the global (a.k.a. detail) attribute value for a particular string
    attribute.  The attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib]
    object.  See [Hom:hou.Geometry#floatAttribValue] for more information.

    attribute.  The attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib]
    object.  The return value is a list of strings.  See
    [Hom:hou.Geometry#floatListAttribValue] for more information.

::`setGlobalAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib, attrib_value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::setGlobalAttribValue
    Set a global (a.k.a. detail) attribute value.  The attribute may be
    specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.  You would typically call
    this method from the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no attribute exists with this name
    or if the attribute's data type does not match the value passed in.
    If the attribute's size is more than 1, the attribute value must be a
    sequence of integers/floats, and the size of the sequence must match the
    attribute's size.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

::`attribType(self)` -> [Hom:hou.attribType] enum value:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::attribType
    Return the enumerated value [Hom:hou.attribType#Global].  Points,
    primitives, vertices, and geometry support the same set of methods for
    querying their attributes, and this method is one of them.

::`renamePointAttrib(self, old_name, new_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::renamePointAttrib
    Rename the point attribute with the specified old name to the new name.
    This method is typically called from within a Python-defined SOP when the
    SOP's geometry is writable.

    Raises `GeometryPermissionError` if called on a read-only geometry. 
    Raises `TypeError` if `old_name` or `new_name` is None.
    Raises `OperationFailed` if no such point attribute with the old name
    exists.
    Raises `OperationFailed` if a point attribute with the new name already
    exists.

::`renamePrimAttrib(self, old_name, new_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::renamePrimAttrib
    Rename the primitive attribute with the specified old name to the new name.
    This method is typically called from within a Python-defined SOP when the
    SOP's geometry is writable.

    Raises `GeometryPermissionError` if called on a read-only geometry. 
    Raises `TypeError` if `old_name` or `new_name` is None.
    Raises `OperationFailed` if no such primitive attribute with the old name
    exists.
    Raises `OperationFailed` if a primitive attribute with the new name already
    exists.

::`renameVertexAttrib(self, old_name, new_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::renameVertexAttrib
    Rename the vertex attribute with the specified old name to the new name.
    This method is typically called from within a Python-defined SOP when the
    SOP's geometry is writable.

    Raises `GeometryPermissionError` if called on a read-only geometry. 
    Raises `TypeError` if `old_name` or `new_name` is None.
    Raises `OperationFailed` if no such vertex attribute with the old name
    exists.

    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::renameGlobalAttrib
    Rename the global attribute with the specified old name to the new name.
    This method is typically called from within a Python-defined SOP when the
    SOP's geometry is writable.

    Raises `GeometryPermissionError` if called on a read-only geometry. 
    Raises `TypeError` if `old_name` or `new_name` is None.
    Raises `OperationFailed` if no such global attribute with the old name
    exists.
    Raises `OperationFailed` if a global attribute with the new name already
    exists.


== Intrinsics ==

::`intrinsicValue(self, intrinsic_name)` -> `int`, `float`, `str`, or `tuple`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::intrinsicValue
    Gets the value of an "intrinsic", often computed, value of the geometry,
    such as `memoryusage`, `pointcount`, `pointattributes`, and so on. Raises
    `OperationFailed` if the given intrinsic name does not exist.
    
    You can also view these values in the user interface using the
    [geometry spreadsheet|/ref/panes/geosheet].
    
    In Houdini, some primitives have "intrinsic" values which can't be accessed
    directly through the attribute interface. Most intrinsic values are
    computed, such as `measuredarea`, however a few are writeable with the
    [setIntrinsicValue method|#setIntrinsicValue]. For example, sphere
    primitives have a transform matrix as part of their definition.
    
    You can get a list of the available intrinsic value names with the
    [intrinsicNames method|#intrinsicNames]. Different geometry types will have
    different intrinsic values available.

::`intrinsicNames(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::intrinsicNames
    Returns a tuple of strings representing the intrinsic values available for
    this geometry. Different geometry types will have different intrinsic values
    available. You can then get or set the value using
    [intrinsicValue|#intrinsicValue] and/or [setIntrinsicValue|#setIntrinsicValue].

    See the [intrinsicValue method|#intrinsicValue] for more information.

::`intrinsicValueDict(self)` -> `dict` of `str` to `value`
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::intrinsicValueDict
    Returns a dictionary mapping intrinsic names to their values.

::`setIntrinsicValue(self, intrinsic_name, value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::setIntrinsicValue
    Some "intrinsic" values can be modified. For example, you change the
    internal size and rotation (transform) of a sphere primitive by passing a 16
    float tuple representing the transform to `setIntrinsicValue`. Raises
    `Error` if the intrinsic is not writeable or does not accept the passed
    value, or if the given intrinsic name does not exist.

    NOTE:
        Modifying the geometry directly will lock the geometry's parent node.
    
    See the [intrinsicValue method|#intrinsicValue] for more information.

::`intrinsicReadOnly(self, intrinsic_name)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Prim::intrinsicReadOnly
    #status: nd
    Returns whether the intrinsic is read-only or can be modified with
    `setIntrinsicValue()`
 
::`intrinsicSize(self, intrinsic_name)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Prim::intrinsicSize
    #status: nd
    Returns the intrinsic value tuple size.

    #status: ni

::`pointBoundingBox(self, pointpattern)` -> [Hom:hou.BoundingBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::pointBoundingBox
    #replaces: Exp:bbox
    Return an axis-aligned 3D bounding box that is sized and positioned 
    to include the points specified by the point pattern.  If the pattern
    is blank, all points will be included.

    Some primitives, such as spheres, extend beyond their points. This
    extension will not be included.

::`primBoundingBox(self, primpattern)` -> [Hom:hou.BoundingBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::primBoundingBox
    #replaces: Exp:bbox
    Return an axis-aligned 3D bounding box that is sized and positioned 
    to include the primitives specified by the primitive pattern.  If the
    pattern is blank, all primitives will be included.

    Some primitives, such as spheres, extend beyond their points. This
    extension will be included.

::`boundingBox(self)` -> [Hom:hou.BoundingBox]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::boundingBox
    #replaces: Exp:bbox
    Return an axis-aligned 3D bounding box that is sized and positioned to be
    large enough to hold this geometry.

::`centroid(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::centroid
    #replaces: Exp:centroid
    #status: ni

::`averageMinDistance(self, local_transform, geometry, geometry_transform)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::averageMinDistance
    Return the average over all points in <<geometry>> of the minimum
    distance to the point set of <<self>>

    local_transform:
        A transform to be applied to all points in this geometry.
    geometry:
        The geometry to find distances from.
    geometry_transform:
        A transform to be applied to all points in <<geometry>>.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if <<geometry>> has no vertices.

    {{{
    #!python
    query_geometry = query_node.geometry()
    queried_geometry = queried_node.geometry()

    query_geometry.averageMinDistance(
        query_node.worldTransform(),
        queried_geometry,
        queried_node.worldTransform())
    }}}

::`averageEdgeLength(self)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::averageEdgeLength
    Return the average edge length of the mesh.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if mesh does not contain any edges.

    {{{
    #!python
    # Return the average edge length.
    geo.averageEdgeLength()
    }}}


== Creation ==

::`createPoint(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Point]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createPoint
    Create a new point located at (0, 0, 0) and return the corresponding
    [Hom:hou.Point] object.  You would typically call this method from the code
    of a Python-defined SOP.

    If the geometry contains point attributes, the new point receives the
    default values for those attributes.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

    See [Hom:hou.Geometry#addAttrib], [Hom:hou.Geometry#createPolygon], and
    [Hom:hou.Face#addVertex] for examples.

::`createPoints(self, point_positions)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Point]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createPoints
    Create a set of points located at the specified positions and return
    a tuple of the new [Hom:hou.Point] objects.  You would typically call this
    method from the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    `point_positions` can be either a tuple of [Hom:hou.Vector3] objects or a
    tuple of 3-tuple floating point numbers.  For example, if `point_positions`
    is `((0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 3))` then this method will create 2 points with one
    positioned at (0, 1, 2) and the other at (1, 2, 3).

    If the geometry contains point attributes, the new points receive the
    default values for those attributes.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.
    Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidSize] if one of the specified point positions does
    not contain 3 values (for x, y, z).

    See [Hom:hou.Geometry#addAttrib], [Hom:hou.Geometry#createPolygons], and
    [Hom:hou.Face#addVertex] for examples.

::`createPolygon(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Polygon]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createPolygon
    Create a new polygon and return the corresponding [Hom:hou.Polygon]
    object.  You would typically call this method from the code of a
    Python-defined SOP.

    The newly created polygon has no vertices.  Use [Hom:hou.Face#addVertex]
    to add them.  The polygon is also closed (see [Hom:hou.Face#isClosed]
    for more information).

    If the geometry contains primitive attributes, the new polygon receives the
    default values for those attributes.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

    See [Hom:hou.Face#addVertex] for a slightly more complicated example.

::`createPolygons(self, points)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Polygon]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createPolygons
    Create a set of polygons with the specified points as vertices and return
    a tuple of the new [Hom:hou.Polygon] objects.  You would typically call
    this method from the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    `points` can be either a tuple of tuples of [Hom:hou.Point] objects
    or a tuple of tuples of integers representing the point numbers.  For
    example, if `points` is `((0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5, 6))` then this method will
    create 2 polygons with one having points 0, 1 and 2 as its vertices and the
    other one having points 3, 4, 5 and 6 as its vertices.

    The created polygons are closed (see [Hom:hou.Face#isClosed] for more
    information).

    If the geometry contains primitive attributes, then the new polygons
    receive the default values for those attributes.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.
    Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidSize] if one of the specified point tuples does not
    contain at least 3 elements.  Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidInput] if one of the
    point numbers or [Hom:hou.Point] objects do not exist in the geometry.

    Example:
    {{{
    #!python
    # Create 6 points in the geometry.
    geo = hou.pwd().geometry()
    point_positions = (
	(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1),
	(1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1),
    )
    points = geo.createPoints(point_positions)

    # Create 2 polygons.
    # The first polygon uses the first 3 points in the geometry as its vertices.
    # The second polygon uses the last 3 points in the geometry as its vertices.
    polygons = geo.createPolygons(
	((points[0], points[1], points[2]), (points[3], points[4], points[5])))
    }}}

::`createTetrahedron(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Prim]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createTetrahedron
    Create a new tetrahedron and return the corresponding [Hom:hou.Prim]
    object.  You would typically call this method from the code of a
    Python-defined SOP.

    The newly created tetrahedron has four vertices and new points
    have been allocated for them.  To build a tetrahedron out of existin
    points, use [Hom.hou.Geometry#createTetrahedronInPlace]

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

::`createTetrahedronInPlace(self, p0, p1, p2, p3)` -> [Hom:hou.Prim]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createTetrahedronInPlace
    Create a new tetrahedron and return the corresponding [Hom:hou.Prim]
    object.  You would typically call this method from the code of a
    Python-defined SOP.

    The newly created tetrahedron has four vertices and uses the points
    that have been passed into it.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

::`createNURBSCurve(self, num_vertices=4, is_closed=False, order=4)` -> [Hom:hou.Face]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createNURBSCurve
    Create a new NURBS with the specified number of vertices and return it.
    You would typically call this method from the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    num_vertices:
        The number of verticies in the curve.  A new point is added to the
        geometry for each vertex, and this point is located at the origin until
        you change its position.  You can also add more vertices with
        [Hom:hou.Face#addVertex].

        The minimum number of vertices for a NURBS curve is identical to its
        order. So for the default order of 4, the curve must have a minimum of
        4 vertices. If you specify too few vertices, this method raises
        [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].
        
    is_closed:
        Controls if the curve is open or closed; see [Hom:hou.Face#isClosed]
        for more information.  If not specified, the resulting curve is open.
        This behavior is different from [Hom:hou.Geometry#createPolygon],
        where the new polygon is closed.  You can also open or close it with
        [Hom:hou.Face#setIsClosed].
        
    order:
       Specifies the curve's order. The default order is 4, corresponding to
       a cubic NURBS curve. An order of 2, the lowest order, will give a curve
       with linear segments.

    If the geometry contains primitive attributes, the new curve receives the
    default values for those attributes.

    {{{
    #!python
    # This code will work from inside a Python SOP, but not from the Python
    # shell.
    geo = hou.pwd().geometry()
    curve = geo.createNURBSCurve(10)
    i = 0
    for vertex in curve.vertices():
        vertex.point().setPosition((i, i % 3, 0))
        i = i + 1
    }}}

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

::`createBezierCurve(self, num_vertices=4, is_closed=False, order=4)` -> [Hom:hou.Face]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createBezierCurve
    Create a new Bezier curve with the specified number of vertices and
    return it.  You would typically call this method from the code of a
    Python-defined SOP.

    num_vertices:
        The number of verticies in the curve.  A new point is added to the
        geometry for each vertex, and this point is located at the origin until
        you change its position.  You can also add more vertices with
        [Hom:hou.Face#addVertex].

    is_closed:
        Controls if the curve is open or closed; see [Hom:hou.Face#isClosed]
        for more information.  If not specified, the resulting curve is open.
        This behavior is different from [Hom:hou.Geometry#createPolygon],
        where the new polygon is closed. 
        
    order:
       Specifies the curve's order. The default order is 4, corresponding to
       a cubic Bezier curve. An order of 2, the lowest order, will give a curve
       with linear segments.

    An open Bezier curve must have `(order - 1) * n + 1` vertices for some
    integer `n>=1` (so valid values for order 4 curves are 4, 7, 10, etc.).  
    A closed Bezier curve must have `(order - 1) * n` vertices (e.g. 3, 6, 9, etc. 
    for order 4 curve). This restriction does not apply to curves of order 2, however. 
    
    As a consequence, you cannot use [Hom:hou.Face#setIsClosed] on non-linear 
    Bezier curves, since the number of vertices would need to change.

    See [Hom:hou.Geometry#createNURBSCurve] for more information.

::`createNURBSSurface(self, rows, cols, is_closed_in_u=False, is_closed_in_v=False)` -> [Hom:hou.Surface]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createNURBSSurface
    Create a NURBS surface in the XY plane centered at the origin with size
    (1, 1) and return it.  You would typically call this method from the code
    of a Python-defined SOP.

    rows, cols:
        Determines the size of the 2D array of vertices defining the control
        points of the surface. The number of cols and rows in each direction,
        must be equal to or larger than the U and V orders, respectively.

    is_closed_in_u, is_closed_in_v:
        Controls if the surface is open or closed in each of the U and V 
        directionss; see [Hom:hou.Surface#isClosedInU] for more information.  
        If not specified, the default behavior is to build an open surface.

    order_u, order_v:
       Specifies the surface's order in each of the U and V directionss. 
       The default order for both is 4, corresponding to a cubic NURBS surface. 
       An order of 2, the lowest order, will give a surface with linear segments,
       essentially a mesh.

    If the geometry contains primitive attributes, the new surface receives the
    default values for those attributes.

    You can move or resize the surface using [Hom:hou.Geometry#transformPrims].

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the number of rows and/or columns
    is invalid.

::`createBezierSurface(self, rows, cols, is_closed_in_u=False, is_closed_in_v=False)` -> [Hom:hou.Surface]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createBezierSurface
    Create a Bezier surface in the XY plane centered at the origin with size
    (1, 1) and return it.  You would typically call this method from the code
    of a Python-defined SOP.

    rows, cols:
        Determines the size of the 2D array of vertices defining the control
        points of the surface. 

        Note that the number of rows corresponds to `v` and the number or
        columns corresponds to `u`, which can be slightly confusing.  For
        example, `geo.createBezierSurface(9, 7, is_closed_in_u=False,
        is_closed_in_v=True)` is valid, but `geo.createBezierSurface(9, 7,
        is_closed_in_u=True, is_closed_in_v=False)` raises
        [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].

    is_closed_in_u, is_closed_in_v:
        Determines if it is open or closed in each of the `u` and `v`
        directions; see [Hom:hou.Surface#isClosedInU] for more information.

    order_u, order_v:
       Specifies the surface's order in of the U and V directions. 
       The default order for both is 4, corresponding to a cubic NURBS surface. 
       An order of 2, the lowest order, will give a surface with linear segments,
       essentially a mesh.
    
    As with Bezier curves, a Bezier surface has some restrictions on the point
    count in each of the U and V directions. For a given direction; if it's 
    open the number of points in the direction must be `(order - 1) * n + 1`
    for some integer `n >= 1` (e.g. 4, 7, 10, ...). If it's open, the number of
    points must be `(order - 1) * n` where `n >= 1` in that direction (e.g. 
    2, 4, 6, .. for order 3).
    
    You can move or resize the surface using [Hom:hou.Geometry#transformPrims].

    If the geometry contains primitive attributes, the new surface receives the
    default values for those attributes.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not

    Create a quadrilateral mesh surface in the XY plane centered at the origin
    with size (1, 1) and return it.  You would typically call this method from
    the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    Note that a mesh object is not the same as a set of polygons defining the

::`createVolume(self, xres, yres, zres, bounding_box=None)` -> [Hom:hou.Volume]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createVolume
    Given the x, y, and z resolution (or size) of a voxel array, add a new
    volume primitive to the geometry and return it.  The values in the new
    volume's voxels are all zero.

    xres, yres, zres:
        Integers greater than zero that specify the size of the voxel array
        in one dimension.  Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if any of these
        values are not positive.

    bounding_box:
        A [Hom:hou.BoundingBox] that specifies the volume's 3D size.  Note that
        this size is independent of the volume's voxel resolution.  If
        this parameter is None, Houdini uses a bounding box going from

== Deletion ==

::`deletePrims(self, prims, keep_points=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::deletePrims
    Delete a sequence of primitives.  You would typically call this method
    from the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    keep_points:
        if `True`, the primitive will be deleted but its points will remain.

    To delete a single primitive, pass in a sequence with one primitive.
    
    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

::`deletePoints(self, points)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::deletePoints
    Delete a sequence of points.  You would typically call this method
    from the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    Note that Houdini will delete any vertices that reference the point.
    For example, suppose you have a box with 6 polygons, each with 4 vertices.
    Also suppose that each point on the box is shared by 3 vertices on 3
    separate polygons.  If you delete one of those points, Houdini will remove
    each of those vertices from their corresponding polygons, leaving 3
    polygons with 4 vertices and 3 polygons with 3 vertices.

    To delete a single primitive, pass in a sequence with one point.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.


== Groups ==

::`findPointGroup(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.PointGroup] or `None`:

    exists.

::`pointGroups(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.PointGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::pointGroups
    #replaces: Exp:pointgrouplist
    Return a tuple of all the point groups in the geometry.

    geometry:
    {{{
    #!python
    def pointGroupNames(geometry):
        return [group.name() for group in geometry.pointGroups()]
    }}}

::`createPointGroup(self, name, is_ordered=False)` -> [Hom:hou.PointGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createPointGroup
    Create a new point group in this geometry.

    `name`:
        The name of the new group.  Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if a
        group with this name already exists.
    `is_ordered`:
        Whether or not the new group should be ordered.  See

    exists.

::`primGroups(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.PrimGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::primGroups
    #replaces: Exp:primgrouplist
    Return a tuple of all the primitive groups in the geometry.

::`createPrimGroup(self, name, is_ordered=False)` -> [Hom:Hou.PrimGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createPrimGroup

    `name`:
        The name of the new group.  Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if a
        group with this name already exists.
    `is_ordered`:
        Whether or not the new group should be ordered.  See

        The name of the edge group.  
        
    Return the edge group with the given name, or `None` if no such group
    exists.

::`edgeGroups(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.EdgeGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::edgeGroups    
    Return a tuple of all the edge groups in the geometry.    

::`createEdgeGroup(self, name)` -> [Hom:hou.EdgeGroup]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::createEdgeGroup
    Create a new edge group in this geometry.

    `name`:
        The name of the new group.  Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if a
        group with this name already exists.    

    Use [Hom:hou.EdgeGroup#destroy] to remove an edge group from the
    geometry.


== Freezing ==

::`freeze(self, read_only=False)` -> [Hom:hou.Geometry]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::freeze
    Return another Geometry object that is not linked to a particular SOP.

    Normally, when you call [Hom:hou.SopNode#geometry], the resultant Geometry
    object retains a reference to that SOP, and is said to be unfrozen.  Each
    time you access points, primitives, attributes, etc. in an unfrozen
    Geometry object, Houdini uses the SOP's latest cooked geometry.  So, if you
    change parameters or change the time for an animated SOP, the Geometry
    object will update to the SOP's new geometry.

    Unless Python SOPs are involved, a frozen Geometry object does not have a
    similar live association with a particular SOP.  If you ask a SOP for its
    geometry and then store a frozen copy of that geometry, when the SOP
    recooks the frozen Geometry object will not update.  Instead, the frozen
    geometry saves its own copy of the point and primitive data, and is
    unaffected by subsequent changes to the SOP.  When a frozen Geometry object
    is destroyed, any geometry copy it created is also destroyed.

    Note that accessing a Geometry object's points, primitives, attributes,
    etc. may be faster when dealing with frozen objects.  You may want to work
    with frozen Geometry in speed-sensitive operations.

    Calling this method on an unfrozen Geometry object returns a frozen
    one.  Calling it on a frozen object has no effect, and it returns
    a frozen object.

    When a Python-defined SOP cooks and runs Python code that asks for the
    SOP's geometry, the returned Geometry object is writable.  Modifying this
    Geometry object affects the output of this SOP.  For efficiency, this
    geometry object is already frozen, so calling freeze on it has no effect.

    read_only:
	If True, the resulting frozen geometry will be read-only.  Use
	read-only frozen geometry to share embedded geometry among multiple
	packed primitives.


== Nodes ==

::`sopNode(self)` -> [Hom:hou.SopNode]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::sopNode
    If the Geometry is not frozen, return the [Hom:hou.SopNode] object
    corresponding to this Geometry.  Otherwise, return None.

    See [Hom:hou.Geometry#freeze] for more information on frozen geometry.

::`sopNodeOutputIndex(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::sopNodeOutputIndex
    If the Geometry is not frozen, return the index of the SOP node output that
    this geometry corresponds to.  Otherwise, return -1.

    For most cases this method will return 0 to indicate that the geometry
    corresponds to the first output.  This method will only return a value
    other than 0 for SOP nodes that have multiple outputs.

    See [Hom:hou.Geometry#freeze] for more information on frozen geometry.


== Points ==

::`points(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Point]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::points
    Return a tuple of all the points in the geometry.

    See also the [Hom:hou.Geometry#iterPoints] method.

::`iterPoints(self)` -> generator of [Hom:hou.Point]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::iterPoints
    #replaces: Exp:haspoint, Exp:point, Exp:points, Exp:pointlist, Exp:poppoint
    Return a generator that iterates through all the points in the geometry.
    
    Whereas [Hom:hou.Geometry#points] allocates and returns a tuple of all the
    points in the geometry, this method returns a generator object that will
    allocate [Hom:hou.Point] objects on demand.  This object is very fast at
    random access into the sequence.

    If you're accessing a specific point by index and the geometry contains many
    points, it is faster to use iterPoints() than points().  If, however, you
    are iterating over all the points in the geometry, it is generally faster
    to use points() than iterPoints().
    
    {{{
    #!python
    # This is preferred:
    geo.iterPoints()[23]
    
    # over this:
    geo.points()[23]
    
    # But this is preferred:
    for point in geo.points():
        ...process point...
    
    # over this:
    for point in geo.iterPoints():
        ...process point...
    }}}

::`globPoints(self, pattern)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Point]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::globPoints
    #replaces: Exp:pointpattern
    Return a tuple of points corresponding to a pattern of point numbers.

    The pattern format is the same one used by the group fields on SOP
    nodes that take point selections.  Elements in the pattern are separated
    by spaces, and elements can be point numbers, point number ranges,
    or group names.

    This method can be useful when writing a Python SOP that works on only

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the pattern is not valid or if it

    Return a tuple of floats containing one attribute's values for all the
    points.

    This method only works on int or float attributes.  If the attribute
    contains more than one element, each point will correspond to multiple
    values in the result.  For example, if "Cd" is a float attribute of size 3
    and there are 3 points with values (0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), and
    (0.8, 0.7, 0.6) then the result will be (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.8,
    0.7, 0.6).
    
    Calling this method is faster than looping over all the points and calling
    [Hom:hou.Point#attribValue].

    If the attribute name is invalid or the attribute is not an int or float
    (e.g. it's a string attribute), this method raises
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].

    Note that you cannot pass a [Hom:hou.Attrib] object to this method like

    Return a string representation of the floats of one attribute's value
    for all the points.  This method is faster than
    [Hom:hou.Geometry#pointFloatAttribValues], and you can use the `array`
    module to convert the string into a Python sequence.

    float_type:
        A [Hom:hou.numericType] value to specify the float data type (either
        Float16, Float32 or Float64).

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the attribute name is not valid, the

    This method is faster than [Hom:hou.Geometry#setPointFloatAttribValues].

    Note that this method can accept more types that just a string: it can
    receive any Python object that supports the buffer interface.  In
    particular, arrays from the `array` and `numpy` Python modules are
    supported, so there is no need to first construct strings from those

    This method only works on int or float attributes.  If the attribute
    contains more than one element, each point will correspond to multiple

    This method only works on string attributes.  If the attribute
    contains more than one element, each point will correspond to multiple
    values in the result.  For example, if "strmap" is a string attribute of
    size 2 and there are 3 points with values ("apple", "orange"), 
    ("red", "blue"), and ("one", "two")
    then the result will be ("apple", "orange", "red", "blue", "one", "two").
    
    Calling this method is faster than looping over all the points and calling

== Edges ==

::`findEdge(self, p0, p1)` -> [Hom:hou.Edge]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::findEdge 
    
    `p0`:

    `p1`:
        The second point that makes up the edge.  See [Hom:hou.Point] for more information.
       
    finds an edge given two points, or `None` if no such edge exists

::`findClosestPrim(self, pos3)` -> [Hom:hou.Prim] or `None`:

    #replaces: Exp:xyzdist
    #status: ni

::`globEdges(self, pattern)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Edge]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::globPrims
    Return a tuple of edges corresponding to an edge pattern.

    The pattern format is the same one used by the group fields on SOP nodes
    that take edge selections.  See [Hom:hou.Geometry#globPoints] for
    more information.


== Primitives ==

::`nearestPrim(self, position)` -> ([Hom:hou.Prim] or `None`, `float`, `float`, `float`):
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::nearestPrim
    #replaces: Exp:xyzdist
    Given a sequence of three floats containing a position, find the location
    on the primitive closest to that position and return a tuple containing
    that primitive, the u value on the primitive, the v value on the primitive,
    and the distance to the primitive.

    Note that the first value in the return tuple can be None if there are
    no primitives in the geometry.

::`findParticleById(self, particle_id)` -> [Hom:hou.Point] or `None`:

::`prims(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Prim]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::prims
    #replaces: Exp:hasprim, Exp:prim, Exp:prims, Exp:primlist
    Return a tuple of all the primitives in the geometry.  The primitives
    returned will be subclasses of [Hom:hou.Prim] (e.g.polygons, volumes,
    etc.).

::`iterPrims(self)` -> generator of [Hom:hou.Prim]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::iterPrims
    Return a generator that iterates through all the primitives in the
    geometry.

    Whereas [Hom:hou.Geometry#prims] allocates and returns a tuple of all the
    primitives in the geometry, this method returns a generator object that
    will yield [Hom:hou.Prim] objects on demand.  This object is very fast at
    random access into the sequence.

    If you're accessing a specific primitive by index and the geometry contains
    many primitives, it is faster to use `iterPrims()` than `prims()`.  If, however,
    you are iterating over all the primitives in the geometry, it is generally
    faster to use `prims()` than `iterPrims()`.

    {{{
    #!python
    # This is preferred:
    geo.iterPrims()[23]
    
    # over this:
    geo.prims()[23]
    
    # But this is preferred:
    for prim in geo.prims():
        ...process prim...

::`globPrims(self, pattern)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Prim]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::globPrims
    Return a tuple of primitives corresponding to a pattern of primitive
    numbers.

    The pattern format is the same one used by the group fields on SOP nodes
    that take primitive selections.  See [Hom:hou.Geometry#globPoints] for
    more information.

::`containsPrimType(self, typename)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::containsPrimType
    Returns whether the geometry contains at least one primitive of the
    specified type.

    `typename`:
        A string containing the name of a primitive type.
        Typical examples are `"Poly"` (polygon) or `"PackedAgent"` (agent
        packed primitive).
        
        To see a complete list of possible `typename` values, run `ginfo -P` on
        a Houdini tools command line.

::`countPrimType(self, typename)` -> `long`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::countPrimType
    Returns the number of primitives of the specified type in the geometry.

    `typename`:
        A string containing the name of a primitive type.
        Typical examples are `"Poly"` (polygon) or `"PackedAgent"` (agent
        packed primitive).

::`primFloatAttribValues(self, name)` -> `tuple` of `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::primFloatAttribValues
    Return a tuple of floats containing one attribute's values for all the
    primitives.
    
    This method only works on int or float attributes.  If the attribute
    contains more than one element, each primitive will correspond to multiple
    values in the result.  For example, if `Cd` is a float attribute of size 3
    and there are 3 primitives with values (0.1, 0.2, 0.3), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), and
    (0.8, 0.7, 0.6) then the result will be (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.8,
    0.7, 0.6).
    
    Calling this method is faster than looping over all the primitives and
    calling [Hom:hou.Prim#attribValue].

    If the attribute name is invalid or the attribute is not an int or float
    (e.g. it's a string attribute), this method raises
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].

::`setPrimFloatAttribValues(self, name, values)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::setPrimFloatAttribValues
    For a particular attribute, set the attribute values for all primitives.
    You would typically call this method from the code of a Python-defined

    For a particular attribute, set the attribute values for all primitives
    from a string representation of a sequence of the specified float_type

    def primIntAttribValuesAsArray(geometry, name):
        a = array.array("i")
        a.fromstring(geometry.primIntAttribValuesAsString(name))
        return a
    }}}

    See [Hom:hou.Geometry#primIntAttribValues] for more information.

::`setPrimIntAttribValues(self, name, values)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::setPrimIntAttribValues
    For a particular attribute, set the attribute values for all primitives.
    You would typically call this method from the code of a Python-defined
    SOP.

    name:
        The name of the primitive attribute.
    values:
        A sequence of int or float values in the same format as that returned
        by [Hom:hou.Geometry#primFloatAttribValues].  See that method for
        more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the attribute name is not valid, the
    attribute is not an int or float (i.e. it's a string), or the array of
    values is not the correct size.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not
    modifiable.

    Also see [Hom:hou.Geometry#primIntAttribValues].

::`setPrimIntAttribValuesFromString(self, name, values, int_type=hou.numericType.Int32)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Volume::setPrimIntAttribValueFromString
    For a particular attribute, set the attribute values for all primitives
    from a string representation of a sequence of the specified int_type
    values.
    This method is faster than [Hom:hou.Geometry#setPrimIntAttribValues].

    Note that this method can accept more types that just a string: it can
    receive any Python object that supports the buffer interface.  In
    particular, arrays from the `array` and `numpy` Python modules are
    supported, so there is no need to first construct strings from those
    arrays.

    int_type:
        A [Hom:hou.numericType] value to specify the integer data type (either
        Int8, Int16, Int32 or Int64).

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the length of the string is not
    `len(self.iterPrims() * byte_size_of_int_type)`.

    See [Hom:hou.Geometry#setPrimIntAttribValues] and
    [Hom:hou.Geometry#primIntAttribValuesAsString] for more information.

    The following example function accepts an `array.array("i")` and sets
    the attribute values to its contents, assuming sizeof(signed int) == 4:
    {{{
    #!python
    def setPrimIntAttribValuesFromArray(geometry, arr):
        assert(arr.typecode == "i")
        geometry.setPrimIntAttribValuesFromString(arr)
    }}}

::`primStringAttribValues(self, name)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::primStringAttribValues
    Return a tuple of strings containing one attribute's values for all the
    primitives.
    
    This method only works on string attributes.  If the attribute
    contains more than one element, each primitive will correspond to multiple
    values in the result.  For example, if "strmap" is a string attribute of
    size 2 and there are 3 primitives with values ("apple", "orange"), 
    ("red", "blue"), and ("one", "two")
    then the result will be ("apple", "orange", "red", "blue", "one", "two").
    
    Calling this method is faster than looping over all the primitives and
    calling [Hom:hou.Prim#attribValue].

    If the attribute name is invalid or the attribute is not a string
    attribute) then this method raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].

    Note that you cannot pass a [Hom:hou.Attrib] object to this method like
    you can with many methods dealing with attributes.  However, you can use
    [Hom:hou.Attrib#name] to easily get the name from an Attrib object.

::`setPrimStringAttribValues(self, name, values)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::setPrimStringAttribValues
    For a particular attribute, set the attribute values for all primitives.
    You would typically call this method from the code of a Python-defined
    SOP.

    name:
        The name of the primitive attribute.
    values:
        A sequence of string values in the same format as that returned
        by [Hom:hou.Geometry#primStringAttribValues].  See that method for
        more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the attribute name is not valid, the
    attribute is not a string, or the array of values is not the correct size.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not
    modifiable.

    Also see [Hom:hou.Geometry#primStringAttribValues].

::`metaballWeight(self, pos3)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::metaballWeight
    #replaces: Exp:metaweight
    #status: ni


== Vertices ==

::`globVertices(self, pattern)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Vertex]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::globPrims
    Return a tuple of vertices corresponding to a pattern of vertex
    numbers.

    The pattern format is the same one used by the group fields on SOP nodes
    that take vertex selections.  See [Hom:hou.Geometry#globPoints] for
    more information.


== Data ==

::`data(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::data
    Return the geometry data in bgeo format.

    For example:
    {{{
    #!python
    geometry = hou.node("/obj/geo1/torus1").geometry()
    bgeo_data = geometry.data()
    open("/tmp/torus.bgeo", "wb").write(bgeo_data)
    }}}

::`saveToFile(self, file_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::saveToFile
    #replaces: Cmd:opsave
    
    Save the contents of the geometry object to a file.  The file extension
    determines what file format to use.

    All file formats supported by Houdini (e.g. geo, bgeo, obj, etc.),
    including extensions listed in `GEOio`, are supported.  If the file
    extension is not recognized, the bgeo format is used.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the path to the file is invalid or
    there were permission or other I/O errors.

::`loadFromFile(self, file_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::loadFromFile
    
    Replace the contents of this geometry object with the data stored in a
    file.  You would typically call this method from the code of a
    Python-defined SOP.

    You may specify any type of file supported by Houdini's File SOP.  See
    [Hom:hou.Geometry#saveToFile] for more information.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the file does not exist or otherwise
    cannot be loaded.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not
    modifiable.

    See also [Hom:hou.Geometry#merge].

::`clear(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::clear
    Remove everything from this geometry object.  The geometry will have no
    points or primitives after calling this method.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not
    modifiable.

::`merge(self, geometry)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::merge
    Merge the points and primitives from another [Hom:hou.Geometry] object into
    this one.  The new points and primitives are appended to this geometry's
    points and primitives.  You would typically call this method from the code
    of a Python-defined SOP.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not
    modifiable.

    See also [Hom:hou.Geometry#loadFromFile].

::`intersect(self, rayorig, dir, p, n, uvw, pattern=nullptr)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::intersect
    Deterimines if a ray (given by it's origin and direction) intersects the
    geometry. The intersection point (in world space), the normal, and the 
    parametric coordinates are stored in p, n, uvw respectively. The primitive
    number of the intersected primitive is returned. A group 
    pattern is optional.

    Raises [Hom:hou.ObjectWasDeleted] if the SOP is deleted.

::`execute(self, verb, inputs=[])` -> `HOM_Geometry`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::execute
    Invokes verb.execute() with myself as the first input, and returns
    the resulting geometry.  This allows one to chain a series of
    verbs invocations: geo.execute(subdivide).execute(subdivide).

    The optional inputs will have the geometry itself prepended.

== Transformation ==

::`transform(self, matrix)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::transform
    Transforms (e.g. rotates, scales, translates, etc.) the geometry by a
    transformation matrix.  You would typically call this method from the code
    of a Python-defined SOP.

    See [Hom:hou.hmath] for functions that build transformation matrices.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not
    modifiable.

::`transformPrims(self, prims, matrix)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::transformPrims
    Transforms a set of primitives (e.g. rotates, scales, translates, etc.) by
    a transformation matrix.  You would typically call this method from the
    code of a Python-defined SOP.

    {{{
    #!python
    import math

    # This code will work from inside a Python SOP, but not from the Python
    # shell.

    def createCircle(geo, num_vertices=10):
        # Create a closed curve with the specified number of vertices.
        curve = geo.createNURBSCurve(num_vertices)
        curve.setIsClosed(True)

        # Arrange the points into a unit circle on the XZ plane,
        # centered about the origin.
        for i, vertex in enumerate(curve.vertices()):
            angle = i * (2.0 * math.pi) / num_vertices
            position = (math.cos(angle), 0, math.sin(angle))
            vertex.point().setPosition(position)
        return curve

    # Create a bunch of circles on the XZ plane, tilt them slightly
    # about X, translate them away from the origin, and rotate each
    # one about the y axis by a different amount.
    geo = hou.pwd().geometry()
    num_copies = 20
    for i in range(num_copies):
        curve = createCircle(geo)
        geo.transformPrims([curve],
            hou.hmath.buildRotateAboutAxis((1, 0, 0), 30) *
            hou.hmath.buildTranslate((2, 0, 0)) *
            hou.hmath.buildRotateAboutAxis((0, 1, 0), i * 360.0 / num_copies))
    }}}

    See [Hom:hou.hmath] functions that build transformation matrices.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not
    modifiable.


== Loops ==

::`primLoop(self, prims, loop_type)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Prim]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::primLoop
    Returns a tuple of [Hom:hou.Prim] objects that make a path connecting the
    primitives provided in the prims parameter. If multiple paths are being
    returned, they will be separated in the single returned tuple by a value
    of None. The paths are generated using the same algorithm used when
    performing loop selections in the viewport.

    prims:
    A list of [Hom:hou.Prim] objects that define the path or paths of
    connected primitives this function should return. Must contain at least
    two primitives.

    loop_type:
    Controls the type of path returned. Can be any of the
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType] values. If using either the
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType.Extended] or
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType.Closed] loop types, the inputs prims
    cannot contain any None entries. Furthermore, each pair of primitives
    is used to define a separate full loop, so the number of primitives
    must be even. If these conditions are not met, a
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] exception will be thrown.

    Raises a [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if it was unable to construct a loop
    from the desired components.

::`pointLoop(self, points, full_loop)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Point]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::pointLoop
    Returns a tuple of [Hom:hou.Point] objects that make a path connecting the
    points provided in the points parameter. If multiple paths are being
    returned, they will be separated in the single returned tuple by a value
    of None. The paths are generated using the same algorithm used when
    performing loop selections in the viewport.

    points:
    A list of [Hom:hou.Point] objects that define the path or paths of
    connected points this function should return. Must contain at least
    two points.

    loop_type:
    Controls the type of path returned. Can be any of the
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType] values. If using either the
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType.Extended] or
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType.Closed] loop types, the inputs points
    cannot contain any None entries. Furthermore, each pair of points
    is used to define a separate full loop, so the number of points
    must be even. If these conditions are not met, a
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] exception will be thrown.

    Raises a [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if it was unable to construct a loop
    from the desired components.

::`edgeLoop(self, edges, loop_type, full_loop_per_edge, force_ring, allow_ring)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Edge]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::edgeLoop
    Returns a tuple of [Hom:hou.Edge] objects that make a path connecting the
    edges provided in the edges parameter. If multiple paths are being
    returned, they will be separated in the single returned tuple by a value
    of None. The paths are generated using the same algorithm used when
    performing loop selections in the viewport.

    edges:
    A list of [Hom:hou.Edge] objects that define the path or paths of
    connected edges this function should return. Must contain at least
    one or two edges depending on the loop options.

    loop_type:
    Controls the type of path returned. Can be any of the
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType] values. If using either the
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType.Extended] or
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType.Closed] loop types, the inputs edges
    cannot contain any None entries. If these conditions are not met, a
    [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] exception will be thrown.

    full_loop_per_edge:
    If set to True, with the loop_type set to
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType.Extended] or
    [Hom:hou.componentLoopType.Closed] loop types, each inputs edge
    is used to create its own full loop or ring. If False, the edges
    are taken in pairs, and so the number of edges must be even.

    force_ring:
    If set to True, this function will return edge rings instead of edge
    loops.

    allow_ring:
    If set to True, this function may return an edge ring if the
    edges provided produce a ring more naturally than they produce a
    loop (for example if two perpendicular edges are provided from the
    same row on a polygonal grid). If set to False, only edge loops will
    be returned.

    Raises a [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if it was unable to construct a loop
    from the desired components.

::`seamPoints(self, seam_half)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Point]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::seamPoints
    #replaces: Exp:seampoints
    #status: ni


== Selection ==

::`selection(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Selection]:
    #cppname: HOM_Geometry::selection
    Returns the current cook component selection associated with this geometry.
    This is the default selection set by the SOP that created the geometry.
