= RBD Point Object =

"""Creates a simulation object at each point of some source geometry, similarly to how the Copy surface node copies geometry onto points."""

:vimeo:RBD instancing
    #id: 113103248

The geometry for each of these objects depends on the instance attribute value of the point. The Position of the simulation object is set so that it is at the location and has the orientation of the source point. 

This DOP can also inherit any other attributes from the source point. If the attribute names match the names of parameters in the [RBD State|Node:dop/rbdstate] data, the values can be used to set up these other aspects of the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] (such as mass, bounce, and glue strength). Inherited attributes are imported as Position data, rather than Geometry data. They can be retrieved using [DOP Import Records SOP|Node:sop/dopimportrecords].

NOTE: 
    The angular velocity attribute is `w`, not `angvel`.

== Attributes ==

You can  [create attributes|/model/attributes]  on the RBD object's
geometry to influence its behavior. Most of these attributes allow
fine-tuning of the RBD by overriding default values set in this
node.

@parameters

Parameter Use Menus:
    Many of the parameters for this DOP have a menu that controls
    how the values of that parameter are applied to the created RBD
    objects. 
    
    The channel name for each of these menus is the word
    `use` followed by the parameter name. So for the Position
    parameter, the menu channel name is `uset`.

    Use Point Value:
        The value inherited from the source point is left
        unchanged. The value of the parameter on this DOP is
        ignored.
    Add To Point Value:
        The value of this DOP parameter is added to the value
        inherited from the source point.
    Override Point Value:
        The value of this DOP parameter is used for the RBD object.
        The source point attribute value is ignored.
        
Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
    Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini
    frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`). The
    latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the
    DOP network level.
    
Creation Frame:
    The frame number on which the object will be created. The
    object is created only when the current frame number is equal to
    this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a
    timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be
    created. 
    
    For example, if this value is set to 3.5, the
    __Timestep__ parameter of the DOP Network must be changed to
    `1/(2*$FPS)` to ensure the DOP Network has a timestep at frame
    3.5.
    
Point SOP Path:
    #channels: /sourcesoppath

    The SOP containing the geometry whose points will be used to
    create the RBD objects.
    
Geometry Path:
    #channels: /geopath

    By default, the `instance` point attribute (which can be
    defined with the [Point SOP|Node:sop/point]) is used to
    determine what geometry is instanced to each point. 
    
    This parameter can be used to override the `instance` attribute with
    a specific SOP path.
    
Extra Attributes:
    #channels: /extraattribs

    A mask that specifies which point attributes should be
    inherited from the source points. The position, rotation,
    velocity and angular velocity attributes are always inherited.
    
Use Deforming Geometry:
    #channels: /animategeo

    Causes the geometry for the object to be pulled from the chosen
    SOP at each timestep. If the SOP contains animated geometry, the
    RBD object's geometry will also animate. 
    
    If this option is used,
    the __Use Point Velocity__ parameter of the [RBD
    Solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver] should also be turned on to take into
    account the deformations when calculating collision responses.
    
Use Object Transform:
    The transform of the object containing the chosen SOP is
    applied to the geometry.
    
Rotate to Normal:
    Determines if the position should be oriented to match the
    source point's normal. If enabled, the point will determine an
    orientation using the normal and up vector attributes, if
    present. If no normal attribute is present, the velocity is
    used. 
    
    The behavior of this option matches that of the [Copy
    SOP|Node:sop/copy].
    
Use Particle Scale Attribute:
    Scales the geometry of each RBD object by the `pscale`
    attribute value on the source points. 
    
    Turning on this option
    causes each RBD object to make its own copy of its instanced
    geometry. Thus using this approach is much less efficient than
    creating a few differently scaled copies of the instanced
    geometry in SOPs, and having the source points instance those
    prescaled geometries.

Add Deformation Hint:
Controls if the deformation hint_isgeometrydeforming is added to the
geometry to store if the geometry is animated or not.  Enabling this
makes it easier for external code to know if geometry will be constant
over time or not. However, it also prevents the geometry from
instancing.

Create Active Objects:
    #channels: /active

    Sets the initial active state of the objects. An inactive
    object doesn't react to other objects in the simulation.
    
Display Geometry:
    Controls if the geometry is displayed in the viewport.  Does
    not reset the simulation when it is changed.

== Initial State ==

Position:
    #channels: /tx /ty /tz

    Initial position in world space of the object.
Rotation:
    #channels: /rx /ry /rz

    Initial orientation of the object. This is in RX/RY/RZ
    format.
Velocity:
    #channels: /velx /vely /velz

    Initial velocity of the object.
Angular Velocity:
    #channels: /angvelx /angvely /angvelz

    Initial angular velocity of the object. This is the axis of
    rotation times the rate of rotation. 
    
    Speed of rotation is
    measured in degrees per second, so a multiplier of 360 will
    cause the object to rotate once per second.

== Glue ==

Glue Object:
    #channels: /glueobject

    The name of an object to glue to. If this is blank, the
    object is glued to no other object and acts normally. If it
    is the name of another RBD Object which it mutually affects,
    this object becomes glued to the other object. Its relative
    position to the other object is maintained by the solver.
Glue Strength:
    #channels: /gluethreshold

    The amount of accumulated force required to break a glue
    bond. A value of -1 will prevent the bond from ever
    breaking. A value of 0 will cause the bond to break with the
    first external force.
Glue Impulse HalfLife:
    #channels: /glueimpulsehalflife

    The number of seconds for the glue impulse to decay by one
    half. Whenever a glued object gets hit, it accumulates a
    glue impulse force. This controls how fast that force
    decays.

== Physical ==

Compute Center of Mass:
    Determines if the center of the object should be found
    automatically from the object's volumetric representation
    and glued sub-objects.
    
Center of Mass:
    #channels: /px /py /pz

    If the center of mass is not computed automatically, this
    value becomes the center of the mass. The center of mass can
    be thought of as the pivot point about which the object will
    rotate.
    
Compute Mass:
    Determines if the mass will be calculated automatically
    from the object's volumetric representation and glued
    sub-objects.
    
Density:
    #channels: /density

    The mass of an object is its volume times its density.
    
Mass:
    #channels: /mass

    The absolute mass of the object.
    
Rotational Stiffness:
    #channels: /inertialtensorstiffness

    When an object receives a glancing blow, it will often
    acquire a spin. The amount of spin acquired depends on the
    shape and mass distribution of the object, known as the
    _inertial tensor_. 
    
    The Rotational Stiffness is a scale
    factor applied to this. A higher stiffness will make the
    object less liable to spinning, a lower value will make it
    more ready to spin.
