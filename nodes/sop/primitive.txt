= Primitive =

"""Edits primitive, primitive attributes, and profile curves."""

In Houdini, each geometry primitive has attributes such as XYZ position,
size, orientation, color, and alpha.

A Bezier surface is a single primitive, as is a NURBS surface, while a
polygon mesh can be made of hundreds of individual primitives.

You can use this operator to:

* Translate, rotate, and scale primitives.

* Apply parametric affine transformations to a profile curve.

  (When transforming profile curves, you can only rotate around the Z
  axis, since the X and Y axes are projected onto the surface and so
  cannot rotate off the surface. Similarly, you cannot scale along the Z
  axis.)

* Make primitives open or closed.

* Reverse the vertex order of all faces.

* Reverse surface normals (for example, to map a texture onto the inside
  of a sphere).

* Apply transforms per-primitive.

* Set primitive attributes such as color.

== Template geometry ==

    Various options let you modify the input primitives in relation to
    another piece of geometry. For example, you can match the normals of
    the input primitives to the normals of the template geometry.

    You can use a group within the input primitives as the template
    geometry (using the __Template group__ parameter), or connect the
    template geometry to this node's second (Template) input.


TIP:
    The local variables in the Primitive SOP are relative to the
    primitive. You can use the prefixes "det", "pt", or "vtx" to use
    detail, point, or vertex variables. For example, `$ptTX, $ptTY,
    $ptTZ` for point coordinates.

@parameters

Source Group:
    Primitive and/or profile group to operate on.

Template Group:
    A subset of template points to transform to.

== Transform ==

Do Transformation:
    Transform the input primitives using the parameters below.

Rotate to template:
    Available when geometry is connected to the second
    (template) input. Rotates primitives to face template
    normals. Match Normals


    Off:
        Do not match the template.
    On:
        Rotate primtives to _face_ the normals of template
        geometry.
    Match normals:
        Rotate primitive so their normals _match_ the normals of
        the template geometry.
Transform Order:
    Order in which transformations occur.

Rotate Order:
    Order in which rotations occur.

Translate:
    #channels: /tx /ty /tz

    Moves primitives along X, Y, and Z axes.

Rotate:
    #channels: /rx /ry /rz

    Rotates primitives.

Scale:
    #channels: /sx /sy /sz

    Scales primitives along X, Y, and Z axes.

Shear:
    Amount of shearing. The three values represent X on XY
    plane, X on XZ plane, and Y on YZ plane respectively.
Pivot:
    #channels: /px /py /pz

    Local pivot point for transformations.

Lookat Object:
    Rotates the input primitives to point at this object.

    Names of the vector attributes to transform using the
    parameters above. You can only transform point and primitive
    vectors can be transformed. You cannot transform vertex
    attributes.

    A value of `*` means to transform all known vector
    attributes. If the field is empty, no attributes are
    transformed.


== Attributes ==

These attribute changes only apply to primitives, not to
profiles.

Color:
    #channels: /diffr /diffg /diffb

    Diffuse color (RGB)

Alpha:
    #channels: /alpha

    Transparency value

Crease:
    #channels: /crease

    Crease weight for polygonal subdivision

Texture:
    #channels: /texture

    Create a string attribute for texture maps

== Face/Hull ==

Preserve Shape U/V:
    If clamping or closing rounded, preserves shape.

Close U/V:
    Closes, opens, or unrolls primitive in U direction.

Clamp U/V:
    Clamps NURBS endpoints to original positions.

Operation:

    Reverse:
        Reverses U for faces, U & V for hulls
    Reverse U/V:
        Reverses U or V.
    Swap:
        Interchanges U, V. Preserves topology.
    Shift:
        Cycles vertices by U/V Offset.

U Offset:
    #id: vtxuoff

    Amount to cycle vertices in U direction.

V Offset:
    #id: vtxvoff

    Amount to cycle vertices in V direction.


== Meta ==

Overview:
    These options apply only to meta-surfaces.

Meta-surface Weight:
    Allows meta-surface weighting.

Weight:
    Weight of meta-surface.

== Particles ==

Overview:
    These options apply only to particle primitives.  They can
    be used to override the options usually set by the Render
    POP.

Particle Render Type:
    Controls if the particle primitive's render attributes
    should be overridden.

Particle Type:
    How the particles are rendered.

    If you are outputting to RenderMan, use Disk for RiPoint and
    Line for RiCurve.

    Spheres:
        Render particles as spheres.
    Disks:
        Render particles as flat discs oriented toward the camera.
    Lines:
        Render particles as lines between their previous and current
        positions. This is similar to how particles appear in the 3D
        viewport.
    Tubes:
        Render particles as open tubes between their previous and
        current positions.
    Capped:
        Render particles as capped tubes between their previous and
        current positions.
    Rounded:
        Render particles as round-capped tubes between their
        previous and current positions.
Particle Size:
    #id: prsize

    Sets the size of rendered particles. To change particle size for
    individual particles, use the [Property POP|Node:pop/property]
    to set the particle's scale (`pscale`) attribute.

Particle Blur:
    #id: prblur

    How long the particles will appear when rendered. For end to end
    connectivity, set this to `1/$FPS`. To stretch particles
    increase this value, or to squash them decrease it.

== Volumes ==

These options only apply to volume primitives.  They can
adjust certain internal parameters of the volume
primitives, such as the behavior when sampled outside
their bounding box or their tolerance for compression.

These options can also apply to VDB primitives where sensible.

Adjust Visualization:
    Controls if the visualization options will be changed.
    This also affects VDB primitives.

Display Mode:
    How this volume primitive will be displayed in the
    viewport.  This does not affect the underlying volume at
    all, just its display-time appearance.

    This also affects VDB primitives.

    Smoke:
        The volume is rendered as smoke.  Values of 0 or less
        are fully transparent.  If lights are present, they
        are self-shadowed with the volume.

    Rainbow:
        The volume is rendered as transparent smoke.  Values
        of 0 or less are fully transparent.  Lights are
        ignored, reducing computation time.  Instead, the
        smoke is colored a rainbow hue according to the
        position in the bounding box.

    Isosurface:
        An isosurface of equal valued voxels is extracted from
        the volume and displayed.  This Display Isocontour is
        used to determine which isosurface is extracted.

    Invisible:
        The contents of the volume are not rendered at all.

Display Density:
    Controls the fall off rate for the smoke visualization.
    Lower values allows the smoke to be more transparent.

    This also affects VDB primitives.

Display Isocontour:
    Which isocontour to extract from the volume.  The default
    of 0 is good for SDF volumes.  Fog style volumes would
    work better with something non-zero, such as 0.5.

    This also affects VDB primitives.

Taper:
    Allows you to override the tapering of the volume along the Z
    direction.  This allows a volume that better fits a camera's
    viewing area, so you can have a greater density of volumes close to
    the camera than far away.

    The X taper can also control VDB primitives that have
    defined frustums.
    
=== Volumes ===

These options only apply to Volume primitives.

Adjust Border:
    Controls if the border type will be changed.

Border Type:
    The behavior when the volume is sampled outside of its
    defined box.

    Constant:
        The border value will be returned.
    Repeat:
        The volume will wrap, returning values from the
        opposite side of the volume.
    Streak:
        The value at the edge of the volume closest to the
        sample will be returned.
    SDF:
        The volume will be treated as a signed distance field.
        The distance from the sample point to the closest
        point on the volume will be added to the value at that
        closest point.  This ensures the volume continues to
        approximate distances outside of its defined box.

Border Value:
    When the border type is constant, this is the value
    returned for out of bounds sampling.

Adjust Compression:
    Controls if the compression tolerance will be changed.

Compression Tolerance:
    When tiles in the volume are compressed this will be the
    tolerance used for lossy compression.  A value of 0 will
    ensure lossless compression.  (Note compression to
    constant tiles will still occur)

=== VDB ===

These options only apply to VDB primitives

Class:
    The semantic meaning of the volume.

    Other:
        No specific interpretation.
    Level Set:
        The volume represents a surface.
    Fog Volume:
        The volume consists of density values (eg. smoke).
    Staggered Vector Field:
        Volume data for simulation grids.

Creator:
    An optional string of the entity responsible for creating the VDB.
    
Transform Values:
    If set, the actual voxel values of the VDB will be altered by transformation operations, when those transformation operations support this.

Vector Type:
    #id: vdbvectortype

    The semantic meaning of the components of a vector volume.  This affects how transformations are applied.

    Tuple/Colow/UVW:
        Does not transform.
        
    Gradient/Normal:
        Applies the inverse-transpose of the transform matrix, ignoring translation.
        
    Unit Normal:
        Applies the forward transform matrix, ignoring translation.
        
    Displacement/Velocity/Acceleration:
        Applies the forward transform matrix, ignoring translation.
    
    Position:
        Applies "regular" transformation, vector translates.

Write 16-Bit Floats:
    A flag to specify that when writing to disk that the volume should be down converted to 16 bit.  This does not affect how it is stored in memory.
