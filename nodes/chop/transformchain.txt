= TransformChain =

"""Combines a chain of translate, rotate, and/or scale channels."""

This CHOP takes translate, rotate, and/or scale channels from its input and
combines them into a single transform. It can be used to compute the world
transform using the output of a [Node:chop/objectchain] CHOP.

The format of the input channel names are expected to follow the
`object_name:parameter_name` format where _object_name_ is specified by the 
__Chain Name__ parameter and _parameter_name_ is a name matching:
`[xr]Ord t[xyz] r[xyz] s[xyz] scale p[xyz] length`.
If the `length` channel is given, then the transform will be treated like a
bone. Namely, its child bone transform will have a parent transform of
(0, 0, -length). 

NOTE:
    The channel values of xOrd and rOrd are integers corresponding to regular transform/rotation order menus.  If a particular channel is missing from its input, the default object parameter values will be used instead.

The name of the output channels will use the last name specified in the __Chain
Names__ parameter.

@parameters

    == TransformChain ==

	In Transform Order:
	    Specifies the transform order when the `xOrd` channel is absent.
	In Rotation Order:
	    Specifies the rotation order when the `rOrd` channel is absent.
	Chain Names:
	    Specifies the _object_name_ to be used for channels in the Rest
	    input. The order of the names will be interpreted as the hierarchy
	    of the object chain. If the value is `*`, then the chain names
	    will be taken from the second input, in the order in which they
	    are found.

	    If an additional name that does not exist from the input is given,
	    then the length of the previous bone object will be used to move its
	    position to the end of the bone.

	    The name of the output channels will use the last name specified in
	    this parameter.
	Pre-transform Name:
	    Specifies the token used for pre-transforms of the __Chain Names__.
	    The full channel name used will be the chain name, pre-transform
	    name, and parameter name all concatenated together in this order.
	Out Transform Order:
	    Specifies the transform order of the output channels.
	Out Rotation Order:
	    Specifies the rotation order of the output channels.
	Out Pivot:
	    Specifies pivot value used for output channels.
	Output Channels:
	    Specifies which channels to output. This is useful to avoid
	    creating extra channels whose values will be assumed to be the
	    default elsewhere
	Use Rotation Hint:
	    If enabled, the __Hint__ parameter will be used.
	Hint:
	    If __Use Rotation Hint__ is enabled, this parameter will be used as the
	    approximate starting value for the rotation channels. If __Use
	    Rotation Hint__ is disabled, then it is equivalent to using a value of (0, 0, 0).
