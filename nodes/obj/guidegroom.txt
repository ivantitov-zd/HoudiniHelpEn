"""Generates guide curves from a skin geometry and does further
processing on these using an editable SOP network contained within the node."""

NOTE:
    The skin geometry is expected to be static. Use
    [Guide Deform|Node:obj/guidedeform] to move curves with an animated skin.

@parameters

== Rest Skin Source ==

Skin Source:
    #id: skinsource

    SOP Geometry:
	Fetch the skin geometry from an Object or SOP node.

    File:
	Load the skin geometry from a file.


Skin SOP:
    #id: skinsop

    Fetch the skin geometry from this SOP.

Skin File:
    #id: skinfile

    Load the skin geometry from this file.

Group:
    #id: group

    Generate guide curves on this group of primitives.

[Include:/nodes/sop/fur_common#skinvdb]

== Basic ==

=== Distribution ===

Mode:
    #id: guidetype

    Scatter On Surface:
	Scatter guide curves on the skin geometry.

    Guide Per Point:
	Generate a guide curve at each point of the skin geometry.

    Use External Geometry:
	Fetch guides from an external geometry.


==== Scatter On Surface Parameters ====

Density:
    #id: density

    Scatter guides at this density.

    [Include:/nodes/sop/fur_common#parmoverride]

Scatter Seed:
    #id: scatterseed

    Scatter guides using this seed value.


Relax Iterations:
    #id: scatterrelaxiterations

    Number of times to relax guide locations after scattering. Higher iterations
    result in a more even distribution of guides at the cost of more computation
    time.

==== External Geometry Parameters ====

Geometry:
    #id: guidegeo

    Fetch guide curves from this SOP node.

Resample To Match Fur Segments:
    #id: guideresample

    Resample guides to the segment count used by this node.

Reverse Curves:
    #id: guidereverse

    Reverse incoming curves. Houdini expects the first vertex of curves to be
    the root of the curve. Use this option if the first vertex of your guides
    is at the tip.

Snap To Skin:
    #id: guidemovetoskin

    Move guide curves to the skin surface. Use this to fix guides that
    are slightly offset from the skin.

=== Guide Creation ===

Segments:
    #id: segments

    Generate guide curves with this segment count.

Length:
    #id: length

    Generate guide curves with this initial length.

    [Include:/nodes/sop/fur_common#parmoverride]

=== Display ===

Display As Subdivision Curves:
    #id: displayassubd

    Subdivide curves in the viewport for a smooth appearance.

Display Color:
    #id: displaycolor

    Display curves in this color in the viewport.

=== Optimization ===

Bypass Editable SOP Network:
    #id: bypasssopnetwork

    Skip cooking of the editable network inside this node. This is useful
    to get faster feedback while adjusting parameters on this node.

=== Skin Attribute Transfer ===

Transfer skin attributes of all types to primitive attributes on the generated
curves.

Point Attributes:
    #id: pointattribs

    Transfer these point attributes from the skin.

Vertex Attributes:
    #id: vertattribs

    Transfer these vertex attributes from the skin.

Primitive Attributes:
    #id: primattribs

    Transfer these primitive attributes from the skin.

Detail Attributes:
    #id: detailattribs

    Transfer these detail attributes from the skin.

== File Cache ==

    See the [File Cache SOP|Node:sop/filecache] help for these parameters.
