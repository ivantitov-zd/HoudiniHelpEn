"""Extracts any information from a DOP simulation that is accessible
through the dopfield expression function."""

The most common use for this CHOP is to extract translation and
rotation channels from DOP objects to apply to Geometry Objects. But you
can also use it to extract collision information, velocity values,
constraint information, and so on.

You can use wild cards when choosing the information to extract, so it
is very easy to extract large volumes of information from a simulation.

NOTE:
    The __Units__ must be set to __Seconds__ if you want to pick up anything from DOPs before frame 24, since the CHOP starts at index 1 (which is 1 second in DOP time).

@parameters

    == Dynamics ==

        DOP Path:
            #channels: /doppath

            The path to the DOP data to extract the information from.
            This consists of a DOP Network path, an object
            specification, and a data name. The format of the string is:
            `dopnet:objectspec/datapath`, just as in the dopfield
            expression. The `objectspec` can contain wildcards to match
            a number of objects, but the `dopnet` and `datapath`
            components do not support wildcards. If just a DOP Network
            path is specified in this parameter, such as `/obj/dopnet1`,
            then it is assumed that the Position information from all
            objects in that DOP Network should be extracted. An
            equivalent value for this parameter would be
            `/obj/dopnet1:*/Position`.
        Record Name:
            #channels: /record

            This parameter controls which record within the simulation
            data is to be examined. The most common value is Options
            which is where most simulation data stores its attributes.
            In the case of impact information, this field would be
            Impacts.
        Record Numbers:
            #channels: /recordnumbers

            This numerical pattern specifies the record numbers from
            which this CHOP should extract its information. The Options
            record generally has only one record. But when extracting
            impact information, a value of `"*"` can be used to extract
            all impact records. A range can also be specified. `"0-4"`
            can be used to extract the first five impact records.
        Field Names:
            #channels: /fields

            Controls which fields are extracted from the chosen records
            in the simulation data. This field accepts wild cards. To
            extract just the translations and rotations from Position
            data, for example, set this parameter to `"t? r?"`. To
            extract all available fields, use the default value of
            `"*"`.
        Include Record Number In Track Name:
            If multiple records are being extracted from the simulation
            data, you should turn on this option to ensure the channel
            names created for each record are unique. Otherwise, the
            values from each record will overwrite the values from the
            previous record. This parameter defaults to being off
            because when extracting only a single record the numerical
            suffix is generally not useful.
        Method:
            Controls the way data is extracted from the DOP Network.

            Dynamic:
                The CHOP extracts only the data from the current
                timestep. Whenever the DOP Network changes to a new
                timestep, the values in this CHOP are updated.
            Cached:
                The CHOP cooks the DOP Network for the whole duration
                of the CHOPs time range. All data is extracted and
                preserved. Changes to the DOP Network do not cause this
                CHOP to recook, as that could be very time consuming. To
                update Cached values in this CHOP, use the Update
                button.
        Update:
            Forces this CHOP to resimulate the DOP Network and recache
            all values if the Method parameter is set to Cached.
            Pressing this button is the only way to update the Cached
            values.
