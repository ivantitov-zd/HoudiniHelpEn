"""Set various options of a viewport.  Replaces viewdisplay."""

:usage: `viewdispset [<<options>>] <<display_set>> <<viewports>> `

The <<display_set>> specifies which geometry the settings should apply
to.  This can be one of:

scene:
    Apply to __Scene Geometry__.
selectscene:
    Apply to __Selected Scene Geometry__.
ghostscene:
    Apply to __Ghost Scene Geometry__.
display:
    Apply to __Display Model Geometry__.
current:
    Apply to __Current Model Geometry__ (in __Show Current Operator__ mode).
template:
    Apply to __Template Model Geometry__.
