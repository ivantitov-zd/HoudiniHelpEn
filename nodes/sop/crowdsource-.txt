"""Creates crowd agents to be used with the crowd solver."""

This node is used as part of a crowd simulation workflow. By default it creates a group of agents randomly scattered on an area specified by the controls. If geometry is connected as input, it will scatter agents onto that surface. If the input geometry only contains points, an agent will be placed at each point position.

@parameters

== Source ==

Input:
    Source of the agent geometry and rig.

    Subnet:
        Asset node or a subnet in current session
    Disk:
        The files are read from disk (need to be created using agent rop)
Object Subnet:
    Location of agent asset or subnet node when __Input__ is __Subnet__.
Cache Directory:
    Location of agent files when __Input__ is __Disk__.
Keep External References:
    Specifies whether the agent primitives should reference the agent
    definition files on disk. If enabled, saving agents to a geometry file will
    only store references to the agent definition files, instead of embedding
    the agent definition in the `.bgeo` or `.geo` file (which produces a
    self-contained, but larger, geometry file).
Reload:
    Reload the files/nodes being referenced (Houdini caches needed agent files; when they're updated reloading them is required).
Rig:
    These parameters are used to specify agent rig bones. These are used in various parts of the crowd workflow such as [Terrain Adaptation|Node:dop/agentterrainadaptation] or [Agent Look At|Node:dop/agentlookat].
Clips:
    Rest Clip:
        Animation clip that has the agent in neutral rest pose (no animation). This is used as reference when modifying agent rig.

== Setup ==

Layout:
    Shape pattern of the crowd agents created. 

    Random:
        Scatter randomly based on the number and area size. 
    Formation: 
        Create a group based on rows and columns.
Area Size:
        Size of the area that will be used to scatter agents onto.
Number:
        Number of agents to create.
Random Seed:
        Used when randomly scattering agents.
Relax:
        Used to push the agents apart to prevent initial self collisions.
Density Attribute:
    Name of the attribute that stores density to be used for scattering agents.
Density Scale:
    Multiplier on the density attribute.
Force Total Count:
    Controls number of agents scattered using density attribute. When off number will be based on the density values; when on it will use value specified by the __Number__ parameter.
Agent Name:
    Name of the agent (this name is also used when referencing animation clips).
Group Name:
    Name of the group that the agents will belong to.
Default State:
    Initial state that the agent will be when the simulation starts.
Color:
    Color of the agent points and wireframe bones.
Scale:
    Size of the agent (sets `pscale` attribute on the agent point).
Min Speed:
    Initial minimum speed for the agent (m/s). This may be adjusted during the simulation by the __Animation Behavior__ settings on the [Node:dop/crowdsolver].
Max Speed:
    Initial maximum speed for the agent (m/s). This may be adjusted during the simulation by the __Animation Behavior__ settings on the [Node:dop/crowdsolver].
Max Turn Rate:
    How fast the agent is allowed to turn when changing direction (deg/sec).
Max Force:
    Maximum force that is allowed to affect the agent (values higher are clamped).
Initial Velocity:
    Initial velocity of the agent.
Heading:
    Initial direction the agents face (if initial velocity given it will override this).
Up:
    Up vector to be used for the agents.

== Randomize ==

These controls allow randomization of parameters per agent.

Randomize Agent Name:
    This will randomize the agent name.
Agent Name Prefix:
    Prefix part of the agent name. The variations will be created by appending random numbers based on the variations/seed parameters (agent1/agent3/agent8/etc).
Variations:
    Number of agents names to create.
Seed:
    Random seed value to be used when creating per agent names
Distribution:
    Type of distribution to be used when creating random values

== Visualize == 

Display Layer:
    Specifies which layer of the agents is displayed. All agents have a 'default' layer which is the skin geometry being deformed. The 'collision' layer is created based on the capture regions of the bones used to deform the agent.

@inputs

Custom Surface/Points:
    Surface to be used as a base to scatter crowd agents onto. If only points are given, these will be used to create agents at each point position.

@outputs

Agents:
    Agent primitives to be used in crowd simulation.
