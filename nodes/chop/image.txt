"""Converts rows and/or columns of pixels in an image to CHOP
channels."""

This CHOP converts rows and/or columns of pixels in an image to CHOP
channels. It generates one CHOP channel per span of pixels in the image.
Pixels, rows, columns or rectangular regions can be extracted from the
image.

There is an optional input which supplies UV coordinates to sample the
image. The input CHOP must contain two channels, one for U and one for
V. The first channel is always assumed to be U. The channels produced
(red, green, blue and alpha) will be exactly as long as the input
channel's length, with a value for each UV coordinate.


@parameters

    == Image ==

        Source:
            Specify the COP Network, and the COP here as the source from
            which the image should be obtained.
        Frame:
            #channels: /frame

            The frame number from which to obtain the image.
        Red, Green, Blue, Alpha:
            Creates a CHOP channel per scanline with the prefix
            specified here, starting at 0. For example, the default is
            "r" in the __Red__ field. If the specified COP is a horizontal
            ramp that is 5 lines high, it creates five CHOP channels (r0 - r4) using the values of the red pixels in those
            scanlines.
        RGBA Units:
            Scales the output to lie in the range `0-1`, `0-255` or
            `0-65535`.

    == Crop ==

        Crop:
           
            Pixel (U.V):
                Extracts a single pixel from the image.
            
            Row (U):
                Extracts a single row from the image. The __V Start__ indicates the row to select, and the __U Start__ and __U End__ indicate the range to extract.
            
            Column (V):
                Extracts a single column from the image. The __U Start__ indicates the column to select, and the __V Start__ and __V End__ indicate the range to extract.
                
            Rows and Columns:
                Extracts an area from the image.
                
            Full Image:
                Extracts the full image.    
            
        UV Units:
            Specifies the units for the following 4 parameters.
        U Start:
            #channels: /ustart

            Starting point for sampling in U. Values outside the range
            of the image are determined by the image's extend
            conditions, in the extend page.
        U End:
            #channels: /uend

            Ending point for sampling in U.
        V Start:
            #channels: /vstart

            Starting point for sampling in V.
        V End:
            #channels: /vend

            Ending point for sampling in V.
        Interpolate:
            Determines the interpolation method when UV sampling with an
            input CHOP is used.

    == Extend ==

        Image Left:
            The image extend conditions when sampling the image with U
            less than 0.
        Image Right:
            The image extend conditions for U greater than 1.
        Image Bottom:
            The image extend conditions for V less than 0.
        Image Top:
            The image extend conditions for V greater than 1. The extend
            conditions are:

            Hold:
                Use the first or last pixel value.
            Cycle:
                Loop back to the other side of the image.
            Mirror:
                Zig-zap back into the image.
            Default Color:
                Use a default color specified below.
        Default Color:
            The color to use when outside the bounds of the image, and
            the Default Color extend condition is set.
