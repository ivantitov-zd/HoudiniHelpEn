"""Supports Bone Deform by assigning capture weights to points based on distance to bones."""

The closer the point is to the center line of the bones, the stronger the
weight will be assigned.

The optional second input can be used to specify extra capture regions
to process in addition to those in the Object hierarchy.

This operation does will not visibly change the geometry (except to
possibly add point colors for feedback). To actually change the geometry
by animating the Capture Regions, append a Deform operation.

Typically one or more Capture Regions are placed in an object (usually
via bones) and named "cregion". The object is then read into a Proximity
Capture through the object's hierarchy. The object is then deformed
using the Deform operation in conjunction with the output from this
operation.

NOTE:
    When a .hip file is loaded, all of the associated capture regions
    are evaluated at the capture frame. Keyframes must be set to
    position the capture regions properly at the capture frame.
    Otherwise, the geometry will be weighted incorrectly upon subsequent
    file loads.


@parameters

    == Capture ==

        Hierarchy:
            Top of the object hierarchy traversed for the Capture Region
            operations.
        Extra Regions:
            The list of paths to extra bone objects or capture regions
            to be used separated by spaces. This list is appended to
            what the Hierarchy parameter specifies.
        Region SOP:
            Specifies the geometry in which to find the Capture Regions.
        Traverse into subnets:
            If turned on, when traversing the hierarchy for capture
            regions, also traverse inside object subnets.
        Create Relative Skeleton Root Path:
            If on, the internal cregion paths are generated with a
            skeleton path prefix that is relative to this sop. If off,
            then the prefix is determined by the longest common object
            path prefix out of all the capture region paths.
        Use Capture Pose:
            If turned on, the capture parameters of bones and capture
            regions are used to capture points. This means that the
            arrangement of bones and the shapes of capture regions are
            capture frame independent. The capture pose can be viewed by
            choosing __Edit > Objects > Bone Kinematic Override: Capture Pose__
            from the menu.
        Cook at:
            Specify when this node is allowed to cook.
        Capture Frame:
            Frame number at which to compute the capture weighting. This
            frame will cook slower than other frames due to the
            weighting computation.

    == Weighting ==

        Weighting Method:
            Specifies whether capture regions captured by a point need
            to be connected by their objects.
        Weight From:
            Weight from either the point location or surface location
            (for NURBS or Bezier surfaces).
        Drop off:
            Specifies the strength of the capturing. Larger values will
            usually mean that more points are captured.
        Max. Influences:
            Specifies the maximum number of capture regions that any
            point will be captured to.
        Normalize Weights:
            Adjusts the capture weights so they add up to one for every
            point. This makes the paint tools easier to use. For
            backwards compatibility, this should be changed to off.
        Destroy Existing Weights:
            Destroy any existing capture weights.
        Blend Factor:
            If destroy existing weights is off, then this parameter
            determines the blend factor of the created capture weights
            with the existing ones.

    == Coloring ==

        Point Coloring:
            Adds point color attributes to show the weighting of the
            points. The color of each point will be a blend of the
            colors of its captured regions.
        Zero Weight Point Color:
            Color used for points with zero weight.

    Force Recapture:
	Forces the operation to recapture immediately.
