"""A convenient tool for exporting channels."""

The Export CHOP is a convenient tool for exporting channels. It allows
you to match a CHOP's channels with different destination channels,
without needing to rename the channels. It also provides an enable input
to turn exporting on or off on a frame by frame basis.

The first input contains the channels to export.

The second input should contain one channel. This channel controls the
exporting of the channels in the first input; if it is 1 at a frame, the
channels will be exported for that frame, if it is 0, they will not be
exported.

NOTE:
    The export flag must be turned on for this node to be active. It is off by default.


@parameters

== Export ==

    Channels:
        The list of source channels. Not all channels need to be listed
        (unlisted channels will not be exported). The order these
        channels are listed is important; they will be matched to the
        paths in the __Path__ parameter in the same order.
    Node:
        #channels: /obj.

        This is the path to the node(s) to export to. It is concatenated
        with the __Path__ field to form the complete path to the channel to
        override. 

	For example, if Node is "/obj/model" and Path is "tx",
        the channel "/obj/model/tx" will be overridden. The resulting
        path will be globbed, so a Node of "/obj/*" and Path of "tx"
        will match any channel named tx in any node inside
    Path:
        The list of destination channels. If there are more destination
        channels than source channels, export will loop back through the
        source channels until all destination channels have been
        matched.
    Active:
	If turned off, then exports of this node will be inactive. The export
	connection will still exist but not be active.
