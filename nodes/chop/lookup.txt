"""Uses a channel in the first input to index into a lookup table in the second input, and output values from the lookup table."""

This CHOP uses a channel in the first input to index into a lookup table
in the second input, and output values from the lookup table. The first
input is the Index input, and should contain a single channel to use as
an index reference. The second input is the Lookup Table, and can
contain any number of channels.

A `0` to `1` in the Index range means that a `0` in the Index (first) input
maps to the beginning (left) of the lookup table, and `1` in the Index
(first) input maps to the end (right) of the lookup table (second
input).

The output CHOP is the same length as the Index input. It is the same
number of channels as the Lookup Table input, and has the same channel
names as the Lookup Table input. The output is filled with the data
extracted from the lookup tables. Indexes that fall between two lookup
table samples are interpolated. The lookup table can be sampled outside
its range. The Extend Conditions are used in this case.

The sample rate of the output is the sample rate of the Index input.

The Lookup CHOP can be used to fetch values from a color lookup table,
where a single index produces red, green and blue channels. It can also
be used for rolloff or decay tables, where it specifies how much a
parameter drops with distance.


@parameters

== Lookup ==

Index Range:
    #channels: /index1-2

    The index range maps the index channel's values to the lookup
    table's start and end. 

    The first parameter represents the start of the lookup table. When the index channel has this value, it will index the start of the lookup table. 

    The second parameter represents the end of the lookup table and behaves in the same way.
    
Per Index Channel:
    Determines how index channels are mapped to lookup tables.

    One Lookup Table Channel:
        An index channels is matched to only one lookup table.
    All Lookup Table Channels:
        Each index channel is matched with every lookup table.
        
Match By:
    Determines how index channels are matched with a lookup channel
    in __One Lookup Table Channel__ mode.

    Channel Number:
        An index channel is matched to a lookup table by its index
        within the clip. Lookup tables are cycled if there are few
        of them than index channels.
    Channel Name:
        An index channel is matched to a lookup table by name.
        Unmatched index channels are left "as is".
        
Match Failure:
    It is sometimes desirable to produce a warning or an error
    when channels in the first input fail to be correctly matched
    to channels in the other inputs. A failure may occur when matching
    by __Channel Number__ if the index input has more channels than the
    lookup table input, or when matching by __Channel Name__ if a channel
    name in the index input cannot be found in the lookup table input.
