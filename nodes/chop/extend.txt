= Extend =

"""Only sets the "extend conditions" of a chop, which determines what
values you get when sampling the CHOP before or after its
interval."""

This CHOP only sets the "extend conditions" of a chop, which determines
what values you get when sampling the CHOP before or after its
interval.

The Extend CHOP has separate menus to control both the pre-interval and
the post-interval. For example, before the interval, you may want to
hold a constant value, and after the interval you may want to cycle or
repeat the curves in the interval.

To shorten or lengthen the interval (the start or end of the chop), use
the Trim chop.

You can see the state of _Extend Conditions_ in the pop-up info of any
CHOP (((MMB)) on the chop tile).


@parameters

== Extend ==

    Left Behavior:
        The extend condition before the CHOP interval.

        Hold:
            Hold first or last value.
        Slope:
            Continue slope at begin or end of channel.
        Repeat:
            Repeat channel in a continuous loop.
        Mirror:
            Cycle channel repeatedly, mirror every other cycle.
        Default Value:
            Use constant value in __Default Value__ parameter.
	Cycle:
            Repeat and offset channel so that it is continuous at the cycle
            start and end.

    Right Behavior:
        The extend condition after the CHOP interval.

        Hold:
            Hold first or last value.
        Slope:
            Continue slope at begin or end of channel.
        Repeat:
            Repeat channel in a continuous loop.
        Mirror:
            Cycle channel repeatedly, mirror every other cycle.
        Default Value:
            Use constant value in __Default Value__ parameter.
	Cycle:
            Repeat and offset channel so that it is continuous at the cycle
            start and end.
    Default Value:
        #channels: /defval

        Value used for the Default Value extend condition.
