"""Constrains to points on geometry or point cloud."""

This tool will position and orient the current object using point attributes from a SOP node. It can also be used to get the closest point on geometry.

== Creating a Points Constraint ==
            
    # Click ((LMB)) the [Icon:OBJ/rivet] Points tool on the __Constraints__ tab.

    # Choose the object you want to constrain to and press ((Enter)).

    # Review the [Toolbar Parameters|#parameters] to create the constraint with or without offset.

    # Select the target object and press ((Enter)). 

    # Select the points/edges or primitives from the target object and press ((Enter)).

This tool creates a new `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object, or reuses an existing one.

A [Points CHOP|Node:chop/constraintpoints] is created based on the selected objects. The constraint is added after the the node that has the output flag and the output flag is moved to the new node.

@parameters Toolbar Parameters

Keep Position:
    When Keep Position is on, applying the constraint won't change the current object position.
