= UV Pelt =

"""Relaxes UVs by pulling them out toward the edges of the texture area."""

UV Pelt operates very similar to how a tanner
creates a pelt. Cuts are made to the geometry to produce a surface
topologically equivalent to a disc. The boundaries of this surface are
connected to a frame and stretched out.

Any closed face can be used as a frame for the pelt. A circle is used if
no frame is specified. A hint polygon is used to specify which section
of the geometry to pelt after performing the cuts. The longest boundary of 
the section containing the hint polygon is the one connected to the 
frame. The frame is parameterized to the range `[0, 1)`. The boundary points 
are spaced around the frame at distances in the frame's parameterization
that are proportional to the edge length with the neighboring boundary
point.

[Include:texture_common#visualizePara]

UV Pelt creates the UV vertex texture attribute if it does not already exist.

NOTE:
    UV Pelt only operates on polygons. Other geometry type such as Bezier
    and NURBS surfaces can be converted to polygons using a Convert
    operation prior to applying UV Pelt.

@parameters
    UV Attribute:
        #id: uvattrib

        The name of the texture coordinate attribute to pelt, defaulting to `uv`.
    Edge Cut Group:
        #channels: /group

        Edges to cut.
    Pelting Method:
        #channels: /method
        Every edge is modeled as a spring. The points are placed to the position that minimizes the spring energy. The choice of Pelting Method affects the strength of individual springs.

        Spring Relaxation:
                Uses spring weights based on length of the edges and the areas of a the faces incident to the edge. 
                
                [Image:/images/uv/uvpelt1.png]

        Tutte Barycentric:
                Uses unit weights except at boundary points. This means that every point is placed at the mass center of its neighbors. The mass of the boundary points is given by the spring parameter. The main advantage of this method is that it always guarantees a one-to-one parametrization (with no inverted triangles) for convex boundaries. 
                
                [Image:/images/uv/uvpelt2.png]

        Discrete Harmonic:
                Uses a weight assignment scheme known as discrete harmonic method which minimizes angular distortion.

        Indicates a primitive group should be created for the polygons
        making up the pelt.

            Specifies an attribute of the input geometry's points that
            will be used to scale the strength of the springs connected
            to the point.
        Hint Primitive:
            #channels: /hintprim

        Use Range:

            #channels: /orientation

            Specifies where on the frame to position the first boundary
            point (the boundary point closest to the hint polygon).
        Weight Attribute:
            #channels: /weight

            Specifies an attribute of the frame's points that will guide
            the process of connecting boundary points to the frame.
