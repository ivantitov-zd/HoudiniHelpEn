"""Reorders points and primitives in different ways."""

The Sort op allows you to reorder points and primitives in different
ways. Sometimes the primitives are arranged in the desired order, but
the point order is not.


TIP:
    To change the order of vertices within a primitive, use the [Reverse
    SOP|Node:sop/reverse].

== Uses / Works in Relation With ==

    * Allow points and primitives to be sorted in different ways.

    * Sorting along a vector aids with transparency viewing in GL.

    == Point / Primitive ==

        Point/Primitive Sort:
            Type of sort to perform.

            No Change:
                Leaves the points and primitives in their original
                order. This allows one to reorder the points without
                affecting the primitive order.
            By Vertex Order:
                Sorts points to match the order of the vertices on the
                primitives that they belong to. If you have a curve
                whose point numbers do not increase along the curve,
                this will reorder the point numbers so they match the
                curve direction.
            By X:
                Sorts points or primitives by increasing X value.
            By Y:
                Sorts points or primitives by increasing Y value.
            By Z:
                Sorts points or primitives by increasing Z value.
            Reverse:
                Reverses the order of the points or primitives. The
                highest numbered becomes the lowest numbered, and vice
                versa.
            Random:
                Using the random seed, each point or primitive is
                assigned a random priority. They are then reordered
                according to that priority. This has the effect of
                generating a random ordering of the points or
                primitives.
            Shift:
                Shift all of the point or primitive indices forward by
                an offset. Each point or primitive number gets the
                offset added to it to get its new number. If this
                exceeds the number of points or primitives, it wraps
                around.
            Proximity to Point:
                The distance to a point in space is used as a priority.
                The points or primitives are then sorted so that the 0th
                entity is the one closest to that point.
            Along Vector:
                Provides a generalization of the By X, By Y, and By Z
                methods. Points are sorted in increasing distance along
                the given vector. This vector is signed. A value of (0,
                1, 0) will be the equivalent of sorting By Y, while a
                value of (0, -1, 0) will be the reverse.
            By Expression:
                The specified expression is evaluated for each point or
                primitive. This determines the priority of that
                primitive, and the entities are reordered according to
                that priority. The point or primitive with the least
                evaluated expression value will be numbered 0 after the
                sort. This will preserve the relative order of entities
                with the same expression value, so multiple Sort SOPs
                could be used to perform a multi-key sort.
            Spatial Locality:
		Points or primitives will be reordered so that objects that
		are close together in space are likely to have similar
		indices.  This option can help to improve the performance
		of random access algorithms such as ray tracing, since
		nearby primitives will reside close together in memory -
		improving the effectiveness of the CPU cache.
	    By Attribute:
		Points or primitives will be reordered in ascending
		values of the given attribute.  Only one component of
		an attribute is sorted, but since the sort is stable multiple
		passes could be done to sort by multiple keys.

		String, integer, and float attributes are supported.
        Seed:
            #channels: /pointseed /primseed

            Seed used for random number generator in Random sort.
        Offset:
            #channels: /pointoffset /primoffset

            Amount to shift point/primitive order in Shift sort.
        Point:
            #channels: /pointproxx /pointproxy /pointproxz /primproxx /primproxy /primproxz

            Position to reference when sorting by proximity to point.
        Vector Object:
            Sort along a vector specified by object's xform
        Vector:
            #channels: /pointdirx /pointdiry /pointdirz /primdirx /primdiry /primdirz

            Specify an arbitrary vector to sort along
        Expression:
            #channels: /pointexpr /primexpr

            Specifies an expression to sort by. Each object is reordered
            so the elements who evaluated to a higher expression value
            will be found after those with a lower value. Elements with
            equal expression value maintain their relative position.
	Attribute:
	    The name of the attribute to sort by.  Must be a float, integer, or
	    string attribute.

	Component:
	    Which component of an attribute to sort by.  The attribute `P` with
	    component 2 will sort by Z, for example.
	Reverse Point Sort:
	    The sense of the point sort is reversed.

	    When __Point Sort__ is set to __No Change__, the points are still reversed.
	Reverse Primitive Sort:
	    The sense of the primitive sort is reversed.

	    When __Primitive Sort__ is set to __No Change__, the primitives are still reversed.
	Sort Vertices by Order in Primitives:
	    When enabled, vertices are sorted to match the order in which they first appear in a primitive.
