    == Scoping ==

        This operation may be restricted to certain planes, or
        components of planes. In addition, the operation may be applied
        to a subset of frames within the sequence. An image must have
        both its frame and plane scoped to be modified.

        Images that are not modified are passed through, which does not
        take any memory or processing time.

    == Scope ==

        Plane Scope:
            Specifies the scope for both the RGB components of Color,
            Alpha, and other planes. The (C)RGBA mask only affects Color
            components and Alpha. 'C' will toggle all the RGB
            components.

            For planes other than Color and Alpha, the plane name (plus
            component, if applicable) should be specified in the string
            field. The pulldown menu can be used to select planes or
            components present in this node.

            A plane is specified by its name. A component is specified
            by both its plane and component name. The '*' wildcard may
            be used to scope all extra planes. Any number of planes or
            components can be specified, separated by spaces.

            Examples:

            {{{
            P
            N.x N.y
            P N Pz
            }}}

    == Frame Scope ==

        Frame Scope:
            Allows scoping of specific frames in the frame range. This
            is in addition to the plane scope (so a plane at a certain
            frame must be both plane scoped and frame scoped to be
            modified).

            All Frames:
                All frames are scoped.
            Inside Range:
                All frames inside a subrange are scoped.
            Outside Range:
                All frames outside a subrange are scoped.
            Even Frames:
                Even numbered frames are scoped.
            Odd Frames:
                Odd numbered frames are scoped.
            Specific Frames:
                A user-defined list of frames are scoped.
        Frame Range:
            #channels: /frange1 /frange2

            For Inside/Outside range, this parameter specifies the
            subrange of the sequence to scope (or unscope). This can be
            edited in Timeline viewer mode (((Ctrl + 2)) in viewer).
        Frame Dropoff:
            #channels: /fdropoff1 /fdropoff2

            For Inside/Outside Range, this parameter specifies certain
            number of frames before and after to slowly ramp up to
            scoped. The operation will be blended with its input to
            'ease in' or 'ease out' the scoping effect over a number of
            frames. This can be edited in Timeline viewer mode
            (((Ctrl + 2)) in viewer).
        Non-scoped Effect:
            #channels: /foutside

            For unscoped frames, this sets the blend factor between the
            input and modified images. Normally this is zero (use the
            input image). By setting this to a non-zero value, you can
            make unscoped frames be 'slightly' unscoped. The value can
            vary between 0 (unscoped) and 1 (scoped).
        Frame List:
            #channels: /flist

            The frame list for 'Specific Frames'. Frame numbers should
            be separated by spaces.
        Automatically Adjust for Length Changes:
            If the sequence range changes, enabling this parameter will
            adjust the subrange and frame dropoff lengths to fit the new
            range.
