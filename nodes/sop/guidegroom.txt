"""Allows intuitive manipulation of guide curves in the viewport."""

This node allows you to interactively groom the guides in the viewport. It can either have a groom object or a skin object as its input.

@parameters

<!--
    Cache Strokes:
        Bakes all recorded strokes into a cache and deletes the strokes.
-->

Reset Strokes:
    Deletes all recorded strokes and the cache, so the output will be identical to the input geometry.

== Initial Setup ==

Primitive Group:
    The group of curves to affect.
    
Collision Radius:
    Controls how far hairs are pushed away from the skin geometry during collision resolution.
    
Curve Segments:
    The number of segments in each guide. When this node is created using the Grooming shelf tools, this is linked to the Fur object's Segments parameter, since that is what will be used during rendering.

== Brush ==

Tool:
    Lets you choose one of various grooming tools.

    All tools have a corresponding shelf tool. These are documented in detail at the links below.

    [Icon:FUR/screen_brush][Screen Brush|/shelf/screenbrush]:
            Groom hair in screen space.
            
    [Icon:FUR/surface_brush][Surface Brush|/shelf/surfacebrush]:
            Groom hair along the surface of your geometry.
            
    [Icon:FUR/cut_hair][Cut Hair|/shelf/cuthair]:
            Interactively trim hair.
            
    [Icon:FUR/length][Extend Hair|/shelf/extendhair]:
            Interactively lengthen hair.
            
    [Icon:FUR/lift_hair][Lift Hair|/shelf/lifthair]:
            Interactively push hair away from the surface.
            
    [Icon:FUR/clump_hair][Clump Hair|/shelf/clumphair]:
            Interactively pull hair into a clump.
            
    [Icon:FUR/part_hair][Part Hair|/shelf/parthair]:
            Interactively push hair away from your stroke.
            
    [Icon:FUR/adjust_length][Adjust Length|/shelf/lengthadjust]:
            Interactively vary the length of the ends of the hair.
            
    [Icon:FUR/smooth][Smooth Hair|/shelf/smoothhair]:
            Interactively smooth areas of hair.

    [Icon:FUR/plant_guides][Plant Guides|/shelf/plantguides]:
            Interactively plant individual guides.

Radius:
    The radius of the brush.

Strength:
    Controls the strength of the effect of various brushes.

Lift:
    Enforces a minimum lift angle while brushing. Only hair that is currently lifted higher than the specified value is affected. The __Collision Radius__ needs to enclose all hair for this to work correctly.

Smoothing Radius:
    The radius within which the smooth tool looks for neighboring guides.

Randomize:
    Values greater than zero will randomize the effect various brushes have.

Constrain Length:
    Turning this off allows you to freely sculpt hair points without any length constraints.

Lock Roots In Place:
    Turning this off will allow you to move the hair and roots around on the skin surface.

Ray Bias:
    Offsets the starting position of rays used for testing whether curves are
    hidden behind skin geometry. This ensures that rays don't unintentionally
    hit the surfaces they originate from.

With the Adjust Length tool:

Target Length:
    Adjust the length of hairs on the brush to this value.

Random Length:
    For each guide, use a random length between the length between the Min/Max value.

Target Length Range:
    The range of lengths from which to randomly pick a length when __Random Length__ is active.

With the Plant Guides tool:

Interpolate Neighbors:
    Interpolate the length and shape of neighboring guides when planting new ones.

Default Length:
    When __Interpolate Neighbors__ is off, use this length for newly planted guides.

Ray Bias:
    This is an offset used when checking whether curve points are hidden by the
    skin geometry. Only surfaces that are at least this far in front of the
    curve point are taken into account. This is to ensure that points close to
    a surface facing the viewer are not regarded as hidden.

    Back-facing points on skin geometries that are thinner than this value may
    be affected by brush strokes.

=== Falloff ===

Ramp:
    Controls the falloff of the brush from the center. The buttons above can be used to apply various presets.

=== Mirroring ===

NOTE:
    Mirroring only works when the guides on both sides are part of the Curve Groom node's selection.

Mirroring:
    When enabled, mirrors grooming strokes as they are made.
Origin:
    The origin of the mirror plane.
Direction:
    The direction to across.
