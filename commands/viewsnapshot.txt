"""Manages the view snapshot memory."""

:usage: `viewsnapshot [-t <<memory>>] [-d <<memory>>] [-h] [-c] <<viewer>>`

This command can record an image from the viewer, display (recall) a
memory image to the viewer, hide the recalled memory, and erase the
image memory.

A viewer argument is a name of a pane for viewing the scene. A viewer
can be subdivided into up to four viewports (such as top, left, front,
and perspective).

Viewers have names of the form "<<desk>>.<<pane>>.<<type>>", where:

desk:
    The name of the desk containing the viewer pane.
pane:
    The name of the viewer pane.
type:
    "world", "particle", or "texture", depending on the contents of the
    pane.

See [how to refer to viewers and viewports|/commands/_index#viewers] .

@options
    `-t <<memory>> `:
        Takes a snapshot of the viewer and stores it in the <<memory>>
    `-d <<memory>> `:
        Displays the snapshot stored in the <<memory>>
    `-h`:
        Hides currently displayed snapshot (if any).
    `-c`:
        Frees all the snapshot memories.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    viewsnapshot -t 4 Build.panetab1.world
    }}}
