"""Solves inverse kinematics rotations for bone chains."""

This filter CHOP generates inverse kinematics rotations for bone chains similar
to the [Node:chop/inversekin] CHOP. The primary difference is that the input
specification is taken entirely from input channels instead of object paths.

The format of the input channel names are expected to follow the
`object_name:parameter_name` format where _object_name_ is specified by the new
__Name__ parameters described below and _parameter_name_ is the name of the
parameter that the [InverseKin CHOP|Node:chop/inversekin] normally fetches from the object scene. If a
particular channel is missing from its input, then the default object parameter
values will be used instead.

There are three inputs.
    First input:
	This contains the bone chain parameters that are typically animated.
	For example, the bone FK rotations and the goal object position.
    Second input:
	This contains the bone chain parameters that are typically non-animated
	such as the bone rest angles.
    Third input (optional):
	This contains a single channel to be used for blending. If this input
	is omitted, then the Blend parameter value is used instead.

== Tips ==
* The goal and twist affector positions must be relative to the parent space of the first bone. You can do this by enabling __Use Reference Bone Length__ on the [Object CHOP|Node:chop/objectchain].

* If the bone objects you are transforming have a pretransform, then these transforms should be included in the second input. The [Object CHOP|Node:chop/objectchain] can be used to easily produce transforms for the second input.
    
* For speed, it is useful to set the second input to only produce channel values at frame 1, since the rest bone chain values are not typically animated.

@parameters

    == Kinematics ==

        Solver Type:
            Specifies the solver to use to generate the channels.

            Inverse Kinematics:
                Uses IK solver. The solution is uniquely defined by the
                end affector position. Constraint parameters are
                ignored.
            IK With Constraints:
                Uses a modified IK solver. The solution depends on the
                previous solution. Constraint parameters are used to
                limit the range of motion.
        Chain Names:
	    Specifies the _object_name_'s to be used for channels in the Rest
	    input. The order of the names will be interpreted as the hierarchy
	    of the object chain. If the value is `*`, then the chain names
	    will be taken from the second input, in the order in which they
	    are found.

	    The transform parameter names that are accepted by the Inverse Kinematics
	    Solver Type are: `xOrd rOrd t[xyz] r[xyz] s[xyz] scale p[xyz]`.
	    Note that the channel values of `xOrd` and `rOrd` channels are
	    integers corresponding to index of the regular transform/rotation
	    order parameter menus.

	    Bone-specific
	    parameter names accepted are: `R[xyz] length ikdamp`.

	    If an _object_name_ has none of the bone-specific channels, then it
	    will be treated as non-bone (ie. the length of the previous bone
	    will not be used).

	    Additional parameter names used by the IK with Constraints Solver Type
	    are: `begin[xyz]range end[xyz]range [xyz]damp [xyz]rolloff`.
	Pre-transform Name:
	    Specifies the token used for pre-transforms of the __Chain Names__.
	    The full channel name used for the second input will be
	    the chain name, pre-transform name, and parameter name all
	    concatenated together in this order.
        End Affector Name:
	    Specifies the _object_name_ to be used for the end affector
	    position channels. The end affector is used as goal for the bone
	    chain.

	    The parameter names accepted from the Source input are: `t[xyz]`.
        Twist Affector:
            For the Inverse Kinematics solver, this specifies the _object_name_
	    used for twist affector position channels. The twist affector
	    controls the twist orientation of the solution bone angles.

	    The parameter names accepted from the Source input are: `t[xyz]`.
        IK Twist:
            For the Inverse Kinematics solver, this parameter specifies
            an additional twist angle to be applied to the solution bone
            angles.
        IK Dampening:
            For the Inverse Kinematics solver, this parameter represents
	    how easily the end bone can be pulled off the end affector as the
	    bone chain is stretched out.
        Blend:
            This option blends between the local bone rotation values (found
	    in the Source input) and the solved solution. When this value is
	    `0` it produces the local bone rotation values and when it is `1`,
	    it produces the solved bone rotation values. If the Blend input
	    is provided, then the channel value there will be used for blending instead.
        Straighten Solutions:
	    When this checkbox is turned on, the bone chain will completely
	    straighten out in the direction of the goal if the IK goal is
	    farther away than the length of the bone chain (with a tolerance of
	    the tracking threshold). If this checkbox is turned off, no
	    attempt is made to further straighten the IK solution. By default
	    it is turned off because it is faster.
        Tracking Threshold Factor:
            This value specifies the accuracy threshold for Inverse
            Kinematic solutions. Use smaller values for more accurate
            solutions at the expense of more computation time. Use
            larger values to save computation time at the expense of
            getting less accurate solutions.
        Clean Rotations:
            Modifies output rotation values such that they contain values
	    as close as possible to the rest angle rotations without changing
	    the solution.
