= Cloth Object =

"""Creates a Cloth Object from SOP Geometry."""

The Cloth Object DOP creates a Cloth Object inside the DOP simulation. It creates a new object and attaches the subdata required for it to be a properly conforming Cloth Object. Cloth objects can be simulated using the FEM Solver.

You can use any polygonal geometry in SOPs to create your cloth object. Your cloth geometry should satisfy [guidelines|Node:dop/clothgeometry] that ensure a fast-running and good looking simulation.

See [cloth forces|/dyno/cloth#forces] and [cloth collisions|/dyno/cloth#collsions]
for more information.
