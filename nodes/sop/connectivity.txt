"""Creates an attribute with a unique value for each set of connected primitives or points."""

The default name for the attribute is `class`.

Each primitive or point is assigned a number from 0 to the number of
connected sets minus 1. Two primitives or points that share the same
number will be connected.

@parameters

Connectivity Type:
    #channels: connecttype

    Determines whether it is to be points that are classified or
    primitives. The attribute will be a point or primitive attribute
    depending on this setting.

Attribute:
    #channels: attribname

    The name of the attribute to create.

Local Variable:
    The name of the local variable to map the new class to. By
    default it is the ALL CAPS version of the attribute.

Seam Group:
    Available only in the Primitive Connectivity mode.

    A group of edges that are treated as additional topological
    boundaries when determining primitive connectivity.

Use UV Connectivity:
    #channels: byuv

    Available only in the Primitive Connectivity mode, and when no
    __Seam Group__ is provided.

    Normally, two primitives are considered connected if they share
    any points. If this is set, they are instead considered
    connected if they have vertices that have the same vertex
    texture cooridinate.

    Note that this applies to vertex texture attribute, not point
    texture attributes.

UV Attribute:
    #id: uvattrib

    The name of the texture coordinate attribute to use when
    __Use UV Connectivity__ is on, defaulting to `uv`.
