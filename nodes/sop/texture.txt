= UV Texture =

"""Assigns texture UV coordinates to geometry
for use in texture and bump mapping."""

The UVTexture operation assigns texture UV coordinates to the source
geometry for use in texture and bump mapping.

When using one of the spline-based methods, specifying a paste hierarchy
in the group field will propagate the computation of texture coordinates
to all of its nodes. Projection methods will typically yield smoother
texture continuity between pasted surfaces than any of the spline
methods. Sometimes it helps ensuring that pasted features are
chord-length parameterized with the Basis operation.

NOTE:
    When the projection type is cylindrical or polar, closed mesh, Bezier
    and NURBS surfaces will be opened. At least one row/column of vertices
    will be added (possibly more for NURBS). This is to prevent poor
    interpolation of texture coordinates at the seam of the join.


TIP:
    Before applying a spline-based texture projection, remap the U
    and/or V bases of the split surface (using a [Basis
    SOP|Node:sop/basis]) between 0 and 1 to ensure a complete mapping of
    the texture. If a single texture map must be shared by several
    surfaces, the surface bases should be concatenated prior to being
    remapped.

@parameters
    UV Attribute:
        #id: uvattrib

        The name of the texture coordinate attribute to create, defaulting to `uv`.
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to apply texture to.
    Texture Type:
        Type of projection to use.

        Orthographic:
            Direct projection from axis
        Polar:
            Wrap spherically in axis direction
        Cylindrical:
            Wrap cylindrically in axis direction
        Row & Columns:
            For geometry constructed as a mesh. The U coordinates are
            placed along rows and the V coordinates along columns.
        Face:
            Maps a copy of the texture onto every face along its normal,
            orienting the texture properly. However, the map is not
            scaled to fit each polygon, nor is it distorted by the shape
            of each polygon.
        Modify Source:
            If the source already has texture UV coordinates, they are
            maintained but may be scaled and offset. See also [UV
            Edit|Node:sop/uvedit] and [UV
            Transform|Node:sop/uvtransform].
        Uniform Spline:
            Polygon curves and NURBS/Bezier curves/surfaces only.
            Samples the basis of each curve or
            surface uniformly in U and V and assigns those values as
            texture coordinates to the surface points or vertices.
        Average Spline:
            Polygon curves and NURBS/Bezier curves/surfaces only.
            The coordinates of each
            control vertex's Greville point are used as the texture UV.
        Arc Length Spline:
            Polygon curves and NURBS/Bezier curves/surfaces only.
            Samples the basis of each curve or
            surface based on arc lengths and assigns those
            values as texture coordinates to the points or
            vertices.
        Perspective From Camera:
            The texture coordinates are assigned so that the world space
            of the object can be textured to fit the projection of the
            camera exactly.
    Projection Axis:
        Axis to project along, or projection method from splines.
    Camera:
        Camera or light to project perspective coordinates from
    Attribute Class:
        Whether the texture is applied to points or vertices.

        Auto Select:
            Let the operation determine the type of uv attribute
            created.
        Point:
            Create point uv attribute.
        Vertex:
            Create vertex uv attribute.
    Scale:
        #channels: /su /sv /sw

        Scales texture coordinates.
    Offset:
        #channels: /offsetu /offsetv /offsetw

        Offsets texture coordinates.
    Angle:
        #channels: /angle

        Rotates texture coordinates about projection axis.
    Fix Boundary Seams:
        Makes sure the texture wraps around correctly.
