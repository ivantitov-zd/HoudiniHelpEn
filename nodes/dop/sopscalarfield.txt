= SOP Scalar Field =

"""Creates a scalar field from a SOP Volume."""

The Scalar Field DOP creates a Scalar Field data that can be attached
to simulation objects and manipulated by solvers.  A Scalar Field is
an axis-aligned box divided into individual voxels.  Each voxel is
giving a floating point number.  The meaning of these numbers could
vary - a signed distance field would store the distance to the surface
and a density field would store the amount of density at the location.
The scalar field is initialized using data from a Volume Primitive in
a SOP.

NOTE:
    The field data is imported from SOPs prior to any transformation defined by the Position Data Path.

@parameters
    Use SOP Dimensions:
        Overrides the __Divisions__, __Center__, and __Size__ options according
        the properties of the volume primitive in the specified SOP.
        This attempts to bring the SOP back at the same size and
        resolution it was supported.  
       
        NOTE:
	    This may not work if the SOP has been transformed, especially if
	    rotated, since the DOP scalar field has to be axis aligned.

    SOP Resize Only:
        Restricts __Use SOP Dimenstions__ option to only override __Center__ 
        and __Size__. This is useful for customizing the resolution of the
        scalar field.

    Voxel Sampling:
        The overall box will be divided into the specified number of
        small boxes, or voxels.  However, the question remains where
        on these voxels the field's values should be stored.

        Center:
            The value will be stored at the center of each voxel.  The
            total number of samples thus matches the number of boxes.
        Face X/Y/Z:
            The value will be stored on the center of the specified
            face of each voxel.  Along that dimension the number of
            samples will be one higher to store the start and end
            voxel's face values.
        Edge XY/XZ/YZ:    
            The value will be stored on the center of the specified
            edge of each voxel.  The dimensions involved will be one
            larger to account for the boundaries.
        Corner:
            The value will be stored on the corners of each voxel.
            The number of samples will be one higher in each dimension
            than the division count to contain all the boundary
            values.
    Border Type:
	The behavior when the field is sampled outside of its
	defined box.

	Constant:
	    The initial value will be returned.
	Repeat:
	    The field will wrap, returning values from the
	    opposite side of the field.
	Streak:
	    The value at the edge of the field closest to the
	    sample will be returned.
    Initial Value:
        When first initialized, the scalar field will be set to this value.
    Scale Values:
	The incoming SOP field will be multiplied by this value.
    Tolerance:
        The absolute tolerance to use for lossy compression of the
        scalar field.  This can reduce memory usage by detecting
        constant areas or using a lower bit-depth representation.  
        
        A value of 0 only allows lossless compression.
    Use 16bit Float:
	The tiles will be stored using a 16 bit float rather than 32
	bit float.  This uses half the memory, but at the cost of
	reduced precision and increased computation.  

	NOTE:
		All computations are still done in 32 bit floats.

    Sop Path:
        The SOP to extract a volume primitive from.  After the
        primitive is extracted, this field is erased.  To reload the
        volume data every frame, use Set Always.
    Primitive Number:
        Which primitive in the SOP is a Volume Primitive to import.
    Time:
        The time to evaluate the SOP at, in seconds. $T is a suitable
        value to evaluate at the current global time.

    Use Object Transform:
        Turn on this option to embed the transform from the parent
        object of the SOP along with the geometry.   
    Re-evaluate SOPs to Interpolate Geometry:
	Normally when a solver asks for geometry data in a sub-step, the
	simulation will simply linearly interpolate position data from integral
	frames. However, this is not exact. Turning this option on re-evaluates
	the geometry network for each substep. This is more accurate, but can
	be very expensive.
