"""Uses capture attributes created from bones to deform geometry according to their movement."""

TIP:
    This node supports the character muscle/joint/etc. deformation
    workflow. To do a cage deformation of geometry, use the
    [Lattice node|Node:sop/lattice].

Bone Deform works in conjunction with a Bone Capture nodes ([Node:sop/capture],
[Node:sop/captureproximity], [Node:sop/bonecapturebiharmonic]) to
deform geometry. As the bones move, this node displaces the points on the
geometry according to the point weights.

Typically one or more Capture Regions are placed in an object (usually a
bone) and named "capture_region". The object is then read into a Capture
operation through the object's hierarchy. The object is moved to deform
the Capture operation's geometry with a Deform operation.

Deform can use Linear, Dual Quaternion or mix both solutions linearly
to compute the deformation.

@parameters

Group:
    Optional point and/or primitive groups to limit the points which
    are deformed.

Skeleton Root Path:
    Specifies the parent OBJ for the bones attached to the input geometry.
    The `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute is used by default when this
    parameter is empty. If this parameter is non-empty, it overrides the
    `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute in the input geometry.

Transform Path:
    An optional path to a Motion FX node that contains channels for
    the world bone transforms, overriding the current state of the
    bones. In Motion FX the Extract Bone Transforms node can be used
    to capture the bone transforms.

Delete Capture Attributes:
    Delete point capture attributes to lighten the geometry data.
    
Delete Point Colors:
    Delete point color attribute to lighten the geometry data.
    
Deform Normals:
    Deforms the point normals to match the deformation of the
    points.
    
Normalize Weights:
    Normalizes the weights for each capture point so that they sum
    to 1 for deformation.
    
Fast Deform:
    This accelerates the deformation speed when the input geometry is not
    animated by using cached values for the capture attributes and
    undeformed point positions.

Assume Only Coordinate Changes In Input:
    Modifies the fast deform algorithm to assume that only point positions
    need to be re-cached when the input geometry has changed.
    Unpredictable results will occur with this enabled if attributes
    or topology changes.
    
Use Dual Quaternion Skinning:
    Enables the Dual Quaternion Skinning algorithm. Dual quaternion skinning is an alternate way of computing the deformation from bones. This method is better for deforming twisting geometry and preventing volume loss than the traditional Linear Skinning method. This is often used for body parts, such as the shoulders of characters.

Blend Dual Quaternion and Linear Skinning:
    Blends the deformation computed using both methods together based on a point attribute.
    If this checkbox is turned on, and if the Dual Quaternion Blend Attribute has a valid float point attribute, a linear blending of the point positions and normals is performed. A blend attribute value of 0.0, will use the Dual Quaternion solution. A blend attribute value of 1.0 will use the Linear solution. A blend value of 0.5 will mix both solutions together evenly.
    
Dual Quaternion Blend Attribute:
    The name of the point attribute to use when blending dual quaternion and linear solutions together.

Deform Vector Attributes:
    Deforms the vector attributes to match the deformation of the points.
    
Vector Attributes:
    Vector attributes to deform.
    
Deform Quaternion Attributes:
    Deforms the quaternion attributes to match the deformation of
    the points.
    
Quaternion Attributes:
    Quaternion attributes to deform.
