:usage: `message [-b <<button1>>,<<button2>> [-p] [-d <<num>>] [-h <<help>>] [-t <<title>>]] text`

In a non- graphical application such as the hscript standalone
application, this command is similar to the echo command except that the
text will always be displayed in the console, even if the command output
is being redirected to a file or elsewhere.

In a graphical application such as Houdini, this command brings up a
dialog box with the specified text. All further commands and processing
are stopped until the user dismisses the dialog.

@options
    `-h <<help>>`:
        Provides supplementary text to print with the message. Use
        single quotes to encapsulate messages containing spaces.
    `-t <<title>>`:
        Give the dialog box a custom title caption. Use single quotes to
        encapsulate messages containing spaces.
    `-b <<button1>>,<<button2>> [-p] [-d <<num>>]`:
        Adds buttons to the dialog box or prints choices in
        non-graphical applications. The choices are comma separated and
        if they contain spaces, they need to be all encompassed in
        quotes. The command returns the choice that the user selected
        (starting with 0 for the first, 1 for second, etc.). If an error
        occurred, like end of file in non-graphical applications, then
        -1 is returned.
    `-d <<num>> `:
        Specifies the index to use as a default choice.
    `-p`:
        This option causes this command to print (return) the label of
        the pressed button instead of its index.
