= UV Transform =

"""Transforms UV texture coordinates on the source geometry."""

The UV Transform operation transforms UV texture coordinates on the
source geometry. Unlike the UV Edit operation, UV Transform supports
animation of UVs.

UV Transform will automatically detect whether the input geometry uses
point or vertex UV attributes, and will affect these attributes
appropriately.

3D transforms are allowed in the UV Transform operation, as the UV
attribute is actually 3 coordinates: U, V, and W. When used
interactively, translates and scales are along the U/V axes while
rotations are about the W axis.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of geometry to apply current operation to.
    
Group Type:
    The type of elements referenced in the Group field.

UV Attribute:
    #id: uvattrib

    The name of the texture coordinate attribute to transform, defaulting to `uv`.

Transform Order:
    Order in which transformations occur.

Rotate Order:
    Order in which rotations occur.

Translate:
    #id: t

    Amount of translation along uvw axes.

Rotate:
    #id: r

    Amount of rotation about uvw axes.

Scale:
    #id: s

    Non-uniform scaling along uvw axes.

Shear:
    Amount of shearing. The three values represent U on UV plane, U
    on UW plane, and V on VW plane respectively.
    
Pivot:
    #id: p

    Local pivot point for transformations.
    
Soft Radius:
    #id: rad

    Area of influence.
    
Soft Type:
    Type of rolloff function.
    
Tangent Angles:
    #id: tandeg

    Angles of the cubic rolloff function's tangents. The first value
    applies to the tangent farthest from the source point, the
    second applies to the tangent closest to the source point.

Kernel Function:
    [Metaball
    kernel|/nodes/sop/metaball#kernels]  to use
    when rolloff type is "Meta-ball"
    
Metric:
    Measure of distance to use when performing a soft transform.
    
Ignore Point Connectivity:
    Affect only points connected to the points in the group, or all
    points within the radius.

Ignore UV Connectivity:
    Affect only vertices connected to the vertices in the group as
    seen in the UV viewport.

Visualize Falloff:
    When to output the soft radius falloff as a `vis_falloff` point
    or vertex attribute.

    Never:
        Never create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute.
    Always:
        Always create and write to the `vis_falloff` attribute. 
    When Viewport Tool Is Active:
        Only create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute temporarily
        when the viewport tool for this node is active.

@locals

CEX, CEY, CEZ:
    The uv centroid of the input.
GCX, GCY, GCZ:
    The uv centroid of the input group.
XMIN, XMAX:
    The X extents of the uv bounding box of the input.
YMIN, YMAX:
    The Y extents of the uv bounding box of the input.
ZMIN, ZMAX:
    The Z extents of the uv bounding box of the input.
SIZEX, SIZEY, SIZEZ:
    The size of the uv bounding box of the input.
