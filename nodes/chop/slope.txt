= Slope =

"""Calculates the slope (or derivative) of the input channels."""

This CHOP calculates the slope (or derivative) of the input channels.

If the input CHOP represents position, the slope can be interpreted as
speed. By default, the Slope CHOP converts position to speed.

In mathematical terms, the slope is the first derivative of the channel
curve. The second and third derivatives can also be calculated. The
second derivative can be interpreted as acceleration (and the third
derivative could be interpreted as the rate of change in acceleration).

This CHOP can be used in conjunction with the [Area CHOP|area] to manipulate
speed or acceleration directly. You can calculate the speed or
acceleration of a moving object with a Slope CHOP and manipulate it with
other CHOPs. Then you can convert the new speed or acceleration curve
back to position data with an Area CHOP. You may need to adjust the
starting position, since the Slope CHOP removes this information. This
can be done with the use of the Constant parameters in the Area CHOP.

The Units option causes the output to be expressed as a change in value
per sample, value per frame, or value per second.


@parameters

== Slope ==

    Type:
        The type of slope to calculate.

        Slope:
            Calculates the slope of the channels.
        Acceleration:
            Calculates the acceleration of the channels.
        Acceleration of Slope:
            Calculates the acceleration of the slopes of the channels.
    Method:
        The sample pairs used to calculate the slope.

        Use Previous And Current Sample:
            The current sample and the sample before it are used. This
            is the only method applicable in realtime applications.
        Use Current And Next Sample:
            The current and the next samples are used.
        Use Previous And Next Sample:
            The previous and the next samples are used, producing
            slightly more continuous slopes than the other methods.
