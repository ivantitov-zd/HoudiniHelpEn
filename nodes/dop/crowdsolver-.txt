"""Update crowd agents based on the custom steerforces and adjusting animation playback of clips"""

Crowd Solver is used to integrate custom steerforces as well as set animation data that is used by agents. The steer forces use custom weights to control their overall effect. The weighting is normalized based on all of the steer forces. The main attributes driving the animation behavior are the `clipnames` (names of the current clips being played), `cliptimes` (current time of the clip being played) and `clipweights` (weights when blending multiple clips together in state transitions).

@parameters

Start Frame:
    Start frame of the simulation.
   
== Particle Behavior ==

Orientation Constraint:
    Min Speed:
        Minimum speed of the agent before change of orientation can occur (this will prevent agents flipping/jittering back and forth at very low speeds).
Speed Constraint:
        The speed of the agent will be scaled based on agent orientation/facing direction and velocity direction. Value of zero will result in speed unaffected, where at __Max Angle__ the speed will be zero. Any values in between will be linearly scaled 0 to 1.
    Min Angle:
         Minimum angle between agent and its velocity when speed is at its full.
    Max Angle:
        Maximum angle between agent and it's velocity where speed is zero.
    Drag:
        Overall drag applied to the agents.

== Avoidance ==

This controls affect how the agent interact with each other to prevent/avoid self intersections.
    
Agent Separation:
    This will force the agent to keep separate of each other preventing self intersections when they are within the search radius. It's used to resolve collisions that are created when agents are very close to each other.
Agent Group:
    Allows user to specify a subgroup of agents.
Weight:
    Weighting of the force used to prevent intersections (higher values will cause the force to have more effect).
Force Scale:
    Scale of the force used to separate the agents; direction is away from the overall group of agents which are affecting current agent.
Braking Force:
    Scale of the force used to slow down the agent; direction is opposite of the current velocity of the agent.
Use Field of View:
    Use field of view when resolving agents. For example with 180 degrees, only agents in front of the current agent will affect it.
Field of View:
    Angle of the field of view being used by the agent. Direction is in the velocity direction.
Force Separation:
    Enforce that agents don't self intersect. Sometimes the Force Scale is insufficient to stop self collisions, this will push the agent to the radius boundary. It may result in popping in very dense areas as agents try to resolve themselves.

Agent Avoidance:
    This will force the agents to avoid each other up to a certain distance based on anticipation time.
Agent Group:
    Allows user to specify a subgroup of agents.
Weight:
    Weighting of the force used to prevent intersections. Higher values will cause the force to have more effect.
Force Scale:
    Scale of the force that is used to alter agent path to avoid other agents.
Anticipation Time:
    How far into the future look for possible collisions (this uses current velocity to project the possible distance).
Anticipation Rotation:
    Controls how much the agent turns away from possible collisions. This value is scaled based on the Anticipation Time; it represents the maximum rotation the agent is allowed per timestep.
Anticipation Braking:
    Scale of the force used to slow down the agent; direction is opposite of the current velocity of the agent.

== Look At ==

This controls agent head override (direction the agents are looking at). To create a target `agentlookat` DOP should be used.

Agent Look At:
    This enables the effect.
Agent Group:
    Allows user to specify a subgroup of agents.
Eye Offset:
    Additional offset to the lookat target (depending on rigs some head bones pivots might be set around neck region this will allow to shift the eye line)
Limit Head Turn Per Frame:
    This will limit how fast the head turns to face new direction.
Head Turn Angle:
    How fast the agent head bone can turn.

== Terrain ==

This controls how agents are projected on the ground/terrain. It also allows for feet projection on the terrain and agent tilt when navigating uneven terrain.
    
Agent Projection:
    This will project the agents on the given terrain.
Agent Group:
    Allows user to specify a subgroup of agents.
Source:
    Source for the terrain object (SOP path or DOP object)
Mode:
        Controls direction of the agent projection.
    Direction Vector:
        Use the direction specified.
    Up Attribute:
        Use the agent Up attribute.
Offset:
    Additional offset that will shift all agents up or down.
Agent Feet Adaption:
    This controls how feet/terrain penetrations is resolved.
Agent Group:
    Allows user to specify a subgroup of agents.
Ankle Offset:
    Height of the ankle pivot position relative to the ground.
Toe Offset:
    Height of the toe pivot position relative to the ground.
Lean Angle Per Frame:
    How fast the agent can lean when moving over uneven terrain.
Backward Lean:
    Minimum backwards tilt when walking down an incline.
Forward Lean:
    Maximum forwards tilt when walking up an incline.

== Animation Behavior ==

This controls how the agent animation clips are played (speed/retiming).
    
Method:
        Lets user specify how the animation should be handled.
    Lock Particle Speed To Mocap:
        Locks the speed of the agent particle to the original mocap locomotion speed. For this option to work, the agent has to be baked with __Convert to inplace animation__ option on the [Agent ROP|Node:out/agent].
    Retime Mocap To Particle Speed:
        The animation clip is retimed based on the agent particle speed and inplace animation speed, set on the [Crowd State DOP|Node:dop/crowdstate].
    Retiming Disabled:
        This will disable any animation clip retiming.
Allowed Variance:
    Lets user limit how much the animation is retimed. This will effectively set min/max speeds for the agents based around the inplace animation speed.
Source Blend Lookup:
    The lookup curve that is used when animation transitions from source state to destination state.
Destination Blend Lookup:
    The lookup curve that is used when animation transitions from source state to destination state.
