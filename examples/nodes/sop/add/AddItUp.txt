This network demonstrates the many uses of the Add SOP to build and manipulate geometry:

- It is used to create points in space which can then be used to create polygons using designated patterns.  These polygons can be open or closed.  Futhermore, each point can be animated through expressions or keyframes.

- It is used to both create points and grab points from other primitives. These points may be used in polygon creation.

- The Add SOP may be utilized to create a polygon using points extracted from another polygonal object.  A Group SOP allows for the creation of the point group that will be referenced by the Add SOP.

- The Add SOP is used to create a polygon from a group of animated Null objects.  An Object Merge SOP references the null points in SOPs which are then fed into an Add SOP for polygon generation.  A Fit SOP, in turn, is used to create an interpolated spline from the referenced null points.  The result is an animted spline.

- The Add SOP is used to generate points without creating any primitives.  Also, points from other objects can be extracted through the Add SOP. 

- Finally the Add SOP can additionally be used to procedurally create rows and columns.
