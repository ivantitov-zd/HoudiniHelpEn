"""Turns key presses into channel output."""

This CHOP listens for keyboard input (on up to nine keys), and outputs
channel data. It creates a single-frame channel for the current state
of each key.

Enter a channel name in a __Name__ field, and choose a key using the
corresponding __Key__ menu.

Each key event gets routed to one destination in this order:

# Input field (only if selected).
# CHOPs (only if used).
# Anywhere else.

<!--
A textport command states where each key is routed (wrt Keyboard
CHOPs).
-->

== Intercept Mode ==

The Keyboard CHOP can only be used while in "Intercept" mode. To
enable Intercept mode, you need to have Scroll Lock on. To use the
keypad number keys you must have Num Lock on.

TIP:
        The background of the current frame number in the playbar will change to orange when Scroll Lock is enabled.

When in Intercept mode, the Houdini Playbar will change to an orange
color and all keyboard input will be redirected to any Keyboard
chops. This means you cannot access any regular keyboard short-cuts
(such as View state keyboard short-cuts, edit OP parameters, or use
the Textport) while Intercept is on.

You can connect the [Mouse|Node:chop/mouse] and Keyboard CHOPs
to the Position and Active inputs of the [Record CHOP|Node:chop/record]
to record channels.

@parameters

== Keyboard ==

Name:
    The name of the channel that monitors the selected key. If
    blank, a channel will not be created.

Type:
    How a key press affects the network.

    Momentary:
        This is simply the up/down state of a key. 0 is up and 1
        is down.
    Toggle:
        This toggles the key state. Push once and it goes on
        (1), push again and it goes off (0).
    Count:
        This increments the channel value by one every time the
        key is pressed. If the ((Alt)) key is also pressed, the
        channel value is decremented instead.
    Pulse:
        This produces a one-frame pulse when a key is pressed.
    Time:
        This returns the length of time that the key has been
        held down. It only works when the time bar is playing.

Key:
    The Key selector, where valid keys are the numbers 0-9,
    letters A-Z, and keypad 0-9.
