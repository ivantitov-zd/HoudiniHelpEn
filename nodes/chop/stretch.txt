"""Preserves the shape of channels and the sampling rate, but resamples the channels into a new interval."""

This CHOP preserves the shape of channels and the sampling rate, but resamples the channels into a new interval. All data in the range is stretched or compressed to the new start and end positions.


@parameters

== Stretch ==

    Interpolation:
        The interpolation method to use when resampling.

        No Interpolation:
            Use the value of the nearest sample.
        Linear:
            Use linear interpolation between samples if CHOP is being
            lengthened. Averages all samples near the new sample if CHOP
            is being shortened.
        Cubic:
            Cubically interpolates between samples, for smoother curves
            than Linear. This method is not recommended for channels
            with sharp changes.
        Pulse Preserve:
            A linear interpolation that recognizes single sample pulses
            and preserves their height and one sample width. A pulse is
            a non-zero value preceded and followed by zero-value
            samples.
    Constant Area:
        If on, keeps the area under the channel constant by scaling the
        the values of the channel.
    Unit Values:
        Determines how __Start__/__End__ parameters are interpreted.

        Absolute:
            The value is the new start/end position.
        Relative to Start/End:
            The value is a shift from the old start/end position.
    Start:
        #channels: /start

        The CHOP's new start position.
    End:
        #channels: /end

        The CHOP's new end position.
    Length Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        Scales the length of the channel after determining the start/end
        interval. Good for doubling or halving the length.
    Reverse Interval:
        Reverses the channel so that it plays backwards.
        
[Include:common#common]

@locals
    C:
        The current channel (0 to NC-1).
    NC:
        The total number of channels.
