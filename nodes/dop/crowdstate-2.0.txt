"""Defines a Crowd State"""

Crowd State defines the current [agent state|/crowds/states]. By default, the node/state name is used for the clip animation that is played while the agent is in that state. The clip name can be overridden, which allows for sharing of animation clips between states. The node also sets animation parameters for the clips that it uses (retiming of the clips is based on those values).

@parameters

RBD Ragdoll:
        Determines the behavior of the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver] for agents in this state.
    Ignore:
        The Bullet solver will ignore the agents and no RBD objects will collide against them.
    Animated Static:
        The Bullet solver will treat the agents as animated static objects, and they will affect other RBD objects in the simulation.
    Active:
        The Bullet solver will simulate the agents as active RBD objects (i.e. ragdolls).
State Name:
    Name of the crowd state.
Clip Name:
    Name of the animation clip to be played in the state.
Randomize Clips:
    This will pick a random clip from all the agent clips that match the `Clip Name` parameter value as a string pattern.
    
    NOTE:
            Clip names must match those written with the [Agent ROP|Node:out/agent].

== State Animation ==

Global Time Offset:
    This will shift the animation for all agents same amount in seconds.
Random Time Offset:
    This will shift the animation start randomly per agent up to the amount specified in seconds.
Type:
        What type of animation is used for the state.
    Inplace:
        Animation is stationary in a single spot and the overall agent world movement is being driven by the particles.
    Locomotion:
        Animation is in world space and agent movement is driven by the Locomotion data (determined when agent data is written to disk with Agent ROP/Locomotion Node).
Inplace Gate Speed:
    How fast the agent is moving in the inplace animation. This is used when the animation is retimed to the particle speed.
