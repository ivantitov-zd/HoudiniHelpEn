"""Adds strength to a glue constraint network according to cluster
values."""

The Glue Cluster operator sets the strength attribute of a glue
constraint network.  If a point has a cluster value of zero, all
polygons connected to the point will have the __Cluster to Cluster
Strength__.  Otherwise, if a polygon connects points of the same cluster
attribute value, they will get the __Internal Strength__.

The optional incoming `cluster` attribute can be further refined with
the __Add Cluster Noise__ and __Random Detach__ parameters.

@parameters

Cluster Attribute:
	The name of the cluster attribute.

Internal Strength:
	The bond strength between two pieces in the same cluster.

Cluster to Cluster Strength:
	The bond strength between two pieces in different clusters.

Impact Propagations:
	When one of the objects is hit, its impact value is spread along the
	glue network.  This allows distant glue bonds that are weak to be
	broken prior to nearer, strong bonds.  The impact propagations is the
	number of rounds of propagation to do. Impulses will not travel more
	than this number of bonds each solve step.

Add Cluster Noise:
	Add cellular noise to any input points with a zero cluster
	attribute value.

Offset:
	The offset of the cellular noise added to the input points.

Size:
	The size of the cells for the noise added to the input points.  This 
	roughly corresponds to the size of the clusters.

Jitter:
	The jitter of the cellular noise added to the input points.

Random Detach:
	Randomly detach pieces from clusters.

Detach Seed:
	The random seed used for detachment.

Detach Ratio:
	The probability that a particular piece will be detached.

Visualize Cluster:
	Color the points randomly according to which cluster they
	belong to.  Points with zero cluster will all get unique
	values.  Usually you will want to use a [Primitive SOP|Node:sop/primitive] to copy
	this to the actual geometry.

@inputs

Glue Network:
	A set of two-point polygons describing desired gluing between
	objects.
