= POP Axis Force =

"""A POP node that applies a force around an axis."""

The POP Axis Force node applies a force around a specified axis. The axis is either a line (Sphere) or circle (Torus).  For force along a curve see the [POP Curve Force|Node:dop/popcurveforce] help.

This operator modifies the `force`, `targetv`, and `airresist` attributes.

    == Shape ==

	Type:
	    Sphere:
		The axis is a line and the fall-off of the force which forms a sphere.
	    Torus:
		The axis is a circle so the fall-off forms a torus.
	Center:
	    The center of the axis.
	Axis Direction:
	    For a sphere, this is the direction of the axial line. For a torus, this is the normal of the circle.
	Radius:
	    For spheres, this is the radius of the fall-off from the axial line.  For torii, this is the radius of the circle that forms the axial line.
	Height:
	    For spheres, this is the length of the axial line.  For torii, this is the radius
	    of the fall-off from the axial circle.
    
    == Speed ==

	Orbit Speed:
	    The speed of the motion around the axis.
	Lift Speed:
	    The speed of motion along the axis.
	Suction Speed:
	    The speed of motion towards the axis.

    == Fall Off ==

	Soft Edge:
	    How far from the center that it switches from full strength to starting to fall off linearly to the edge.

	    This is a ratio, so 0.25 means 25% of the way to the radius.
	Inner Strength:
	    The strength of the force up to the soft edge.
	Outer Strength:
	    The strength at the end of the fall off region.
