Houdini's interface is divided into rectanglar _panes_, with each pane containing at least one editor or view tab. You can add more tabs, just like browser tabs, where each tab contains a different pane type, or similar pane types viewing different data.

[Image:/images/ui/panes.jpg]

* You can add, remove, resize, and reconfigure the panes. You can switch to alternative layouts, and create and save your own custom layouts.

* You can have multiple pane tabs of the same type. For example, you can have one network pane following the selection, and another network pane that always 

* Panes can exist in [floating windows|#floating] on top of the main window.


== Desktops == (layouts)

Houdini ships with different _desktops_ suited to different tasks. A desktop is a *preset pane layout, set of [shelf tabs|/shelf/], and default [radial menu|radialmenus]* designed for specific tasks, such as modeling or shader building. Houdini ships with several pre-made desktops, and you can also save and use your own custom desktops.

You can work with desktops using the [Icon:BUTTONS/layout] desktops list pop-up menu at the top of the main window.

[Image:/images/ui/desktop_radial_menus.png]

:platform:Mac:
    On Mac, Houdini has a __Desktops__ menu in the main menus instead of a pop-up in the main window.

:task: Switch to a different pane layout:
    Open the Desktop list menu and choose the desktop to switch to.

:task: Save the current pane configuration, shelf setup, and radial menu as a new desktop:
    Open the Desktop list menu and choose __Save current desktop as__.

:task: Save any changes you've made to the current desktop:
    Open the Desktop list menu and choose __Save current desktop__.
    
:task:Revert to the last saved version of the current layout:
    Open the Desktop list menu and choose __Reload current desktop__.

:task:Delete, rename, and manage saved desktops:
    Open the Desktop list menu and choose __Desktop manager__ to open the [desktop manager window|/ref/windows/desks].

:task:Start with a completely blank configuration:
    Open the Desktop list menu and choose __New desktop__.
    
    The new desktop starts with a single viewer pane and blank shelf. You will have to re-add the shelf tabs you want to be available in the new desktop. See [how to use the shelf|/shelf/].


== Pane management ==

[Image:/images/ui/pane_header_anno.png]

:task: Resize panes:
    Drag the divider between the panes.

:task: Collapse the panes on one side of a divider:
    Click one of the arrows near the center of the divider. You can click the arrow again to expand the panes again.

:task: Maximize a pane:
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/maximize] maximize button in the pane's tab bar.

:task: Create a new tab:
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/new_tab] new tab icon in a pane's tab bar and choose the [pane type|#types] for the new tab.

:task: Save and restore different pane layouts:
    See [pane layouts|#layouts] below.


== Setting up a new pane layout == (setup)

These are some useful controls for large-scale editing of the pane layout.

TIP:
    If you mess up the pane layout, you can reset to the last saved version of the layout by opening the Desktop list pop-up and choosing __Reload current desktop__.

:task: Split a pane into two new panes:
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] pane's menu and choose __Split left/right__ or __Split top/bottom__.

:task: Delete a pane and all its tabs:
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] pane's menu and choose __Close pane (all tabs)__.

:task: Swap the panes on either side of a divider:
    Click the center of the divider.

:task: Switch a vertical divider to horizontal or horizontal to vertical:
    ((Alt))-click the center of the divider.


== Floating panes == (floating)

You can open a new window that floats above the main window that can hold its own set of panes and tabs. This is especially useful when you have multiple monitors. You can keep a second window full of useful panes on a separate monitor from the main window.

TIP:
    You can drag and drop pane tabs between panels and between a panel and the main Houdini window.

:task:Create a new panel window:
    Choose __Window > New floating panel__.
        
:task:Set up a panel to appear only when a certain desktop is active:
    Open the [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] pane menu and choose __Floating panel > Attach this panel to desktop__.
        
    TIP:
        Any floating panels that are open when you save the desktop are "attached" to the desktop, so they are only visible when that desktop is active.


=== Floating panel menu ===

All panes in a panel have an extra __Floating Panel__ submenu in the [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] pane menu, containing the following items:

TIP:
    When you choose a __Move X to this panel__ item (for example, __Move main menu to this panel__), the item changes to __Reset X to desktop__ (e.g. __Reset menu menu to desktop__). Choosing the item again resets the user interface element back to its default place in the main Houdini window.

Attach this Panel to Desktop:
    When this option is on, the panel only appears when the current desktop (pane configuration) is open. See [how to use desktops|#desktops] above.

Fullscreen Panel:
    When this option is on, the panel fills the screen without any window border. This is useful for a floating panel on a secondary monitor in a multi-monitor setup.

Move Main Menu to this Panel:
    Moves the [main menu|/ref/menus] from the main Houdini window to the top of this panel.
    
    This item is only available on Windows and Linux. See also [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] > __Pane interface > Move main menu here__, which puts the main menu at the top of an individual pane rather than across the top of all panes in a panel.

Move Shelf to this Panel:
    Moves the [shelf|/shelf/] from the main Houdini window to the top of this panel.
    
    After you use this command to move the shelf, it changes to __Reset shelf to desktop__. Choose this item to return the main menu to its default position in the main Houdini window.

Move playbar to this Panel:
    Moves the [playbar|/anim/playbar] to the bottom of this panel instead of along the bottom of the entire main window.
    
Move Status Bar to this Panel:
    Moves the [status bar|/ref/windows/main] to the bottom of this panel instead of along the bottom of the entire main window. Only available on Windows and Linux.


== Pane location and pinning tabs ==

Viewer and editor panes show the path of the at the top of the pane.

[Image:/images/ui/path_gadget_anno.png]

* Click any of the components of the path to jump to that network level.

* Right click the path for a menu of options.

* Click the menu button at the right end, or click the arrows at the left end to navigate through the history of locations.

* Press ((Ctrl + L)) to hand-edit the location if you know the exact path you want to go to.


=== Pinning === (pinning)

By default, all panes are _unpinned_, meaning they follow the current selection. For example:

* When you dive into a Geometry container in the network editor, the 3D view also switches to the show the geometry network inside.

* When you select a node in the network editor, the parameter editor switches to show the parameters for the selected node.

You can _pin_ individual panes to their current network/node. For example, you can pin a parameter editor tab to always show the same node instead of following the selection, or pin a network editor tab

Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/unpinned] Pin button at the top of a pane tab to pin the tab to its current network/node. When the button is [Icon:BUTTONS/pinned] pushed in, the tab will not follow the selection.

TIP:
    When you create new tabs of certain types, such as new network editor tabs, Houdini automatically creates them pinned, since it assumes you only need one pane automatically following the selection.


=== Advanced: tab linking === (linking)

NOTE:
    Tab linking can be complicated and unintuitive. Longtime Houdini users may have workflows that rely on linking, but new users can probably ignore it and just use pinning and unpinning.

The default unpinned tabs follow each others' selection because they are _linked_.  Linking is kind of like watching a channel: all the default tabs are watching the channel called *Last Selected Node*, so when the selected node changes, the linked tabs switch to that network. You can choose to tune some tabs into a different channel (for example, channel *1* or channel *2*), so that those tabs will change networks together, and ignore changes to the locations of tabs that are watching other channels.

To set a tab's channel, right click the [Icon:BUTTONS/unpinned] Pin button at the top of the tab, then choose a channel for the tab to follow.

* "No link" means the tab is pinned, so it won't change in response to what happens in other tabs. The pin icon changes to the [Icon:BUTTONS/pinned] pinned icon.

* "Last Selected Node" means the tab is unpinned, so it will follow the selected node. The pin icon changes to the [Icon:BUTTONS/unpinned] unpinned icon.

* Choosing a channel number means all tabs on that channel will change networks together. The pin icon changes to show the channel number instead of an icon.


== Tips and tricks ==

* You can have Houdini color code panes by the type of network they're viewing. This might be useful to help keep track of when you're viewing an object, geometry, or dynamics network.

    Choose __Edit > Preferences > General User Interface__ and turn on __Color pane headers with network contexts__.

* Right click an existing tab to change its pane type.

* Drag the [Icon:BUTTONS/sync] sync icon from one pane onto another to switch that pane to the first pane's location.

* You can switch tabs in the pane under the mouse using hotkeys:

    ((Ctrl + PgDn)) |
        #width: 33%

        Next tab

    ((Ctrl + PgUp)) |
        Previous tab
