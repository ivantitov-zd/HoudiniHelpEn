= RBD Object =

"""Creates an RBD Object from SOP Geometry."""

The RBD Object DOP creates an RBD Object inside the DOP simulation. It
creates a new object and attaches the subdata required for it to be a
properly conforming RBD Object.

== Attributes ==

    You can  [create attributes|/model/attributes]  on the RBD object's
    geometry to influence its behavior. Most of these attributes allow
    fine-tuning of the RBD by overriding default values set in this
    node.

@parameters

    [Include:standard_objcreation]

    SOP Path:
        #channels: /soppath

        The path to a SOP (or an Object, in which case the display SOP
        is used) which will be the geometry for this object. This
        parameter can also be a list of Object or SOP paths, and can
        include wild card specifications or operator groups or bundles.
        
        If multiple Objects or SOPs match this string, a separate
        simulation object will be created for each matching SOP.
    Use Deforming Geometry:
        #channels: /animategeo

        Causes the geometry for the object to be pulled from the chosen
        SOP at each timestep. If the SOP contains animated geometry, the
        RBD object's geometry will also animate. 
        
        If this option is used,
        the Use Point Velocity parameter of the RBD Solver should also
        be turned on to take into account the deformations when
        calculating collision responses.
    Use Object Transform:
        The transform of the object containing the chosen SOP is
        applied to the geometry. This is useful if the initial location
        of the geometry is defined by an object transform. 
        
        If you want
        to transfer an object whose movement is defined at the object
        level, you should use the Object Position DOP instead.
    Create Active Object:
        #channels: /active

        Sets the initial active state of the object. An inactive object
        does not react to other objects in the simulation.

    Display Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry is displayed in the viewport.  Does
        not reset the simulation when it is changed.

    == Initial State ==

        Position:
            #channels: /tx /ty /tz

            Initial position in world space of the object.
        Rotation:
            #channels: /rx /ry /rz

            Initial orientation of the object. This is in RX/RY/RZ
            format.
        Velocity:
            #channels: /velx /vely /velz

            Initial velocity of the object.
        Angular Velocity:
            #channels: /angvelx /angvely /angvelz

            Initial angular velocity of the object. This is the axis of
            rotation times the rate of rotation. 
            
            Speed of rotation is
            measured in degrees per second, so a multiplier of 360 will
            cause the object to rotate once per second.

        Inherit Velocity from Point Velocity:
            When one brings in a moving piece of geometry from an
            external source one does not always know the precise
            velocity and angular velocity. 

	    If this toggle is set, the
            point velocity attribute of the geometry will be used to
            calculate the estimated velocity and angular velocity of the
            object. This allows one to effect a smooth hand off even if
            the source geometry came from a sequence of geometries
            rather than a simulation.
    == Glue ==

        Glue to Object:
            #channels: /glueobject

            The name of an object to glue to. If this is blank, the
            object is glued to no other object and acts normally. If it
            is the name of another RBD Object which it mutually affects,
            this object becomes glued to the other object. Its relative
            position to the other object is maintained by the solver.
        Glue Strength:
            #channels: /gluethreshold

            The amount of accumulated force required to break a glue
            bond. A value of -1 will prevent the bond from ever
            breaking. A value of 0 will cause the bond to break with the
            first external force.
        Glue Impulse HalfLife:
            #channels: /glueimpulsehalflife

            The number of seconds for the glue impulse to decay by one
            half. Whenever a glued object gets hit, it accumulates a
            glue impulse force. This controls how fast that force
            decays.

    == Physical ==

        Compute Center of Mass:
            Determines if the center of the object should be found
            automatically from the object's volumetric representation
            and glued sub-objects.
        Center of Mass:
            #channels: /px /py /pz

            If the center of mass is not computed automatically, this
            value becomes the center of the mass. The center of mass can
            be thought of as the pivot point about which the object will
            rotate. This is useful to set yourself if you want an object to tip in a certain direction without having to animate it manually.
        Compute Mass:
            Determines if the mass will be calculated automatically
            from the object's volumetric representation and glued
            sub-objects.
        Density:
            #channels: /density

            The mass of an object is its volume times its density.
        Mass:
            #channels: /mass

            The absolute mass of the object.
        Rotational Stiffness:
            #channels: /inertialtensorstiffness

            When an object receives a glancing blow, it will often
            acquire a spin. The amount of spin acquired depends on the
            shape and mass distribution of the object, known as the
            _inertial tensor_. 
            
            The Rotational Stiffness is a scale
            factor applied to this. A higher stiffness will make the
            object less liable to spinning, a lower value will make it
            more ready to spin.
