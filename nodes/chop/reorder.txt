= Reorder =

"""Reorders the first input CHOP's channels by numeric or alphabetic
patterns."""

This CHOP reorders the first input CHOP's channels by numeric or
alphabetic patterns. Either a channel pattern specifies the new order,
or a number sequence specifies the new order.

If the second input, the _Order Reference_ is present, the __Numeric
Pattern__ and __Character Pattern__ are ignored, and the first input CHOP's
channels are reordered to match as well as possible the reference
CHOP's. In this case, __Method__ is not used.

Channel values are never affected.

== Examples ==

    All examples assume the __Remaining Position__ is __At Ending__ and the
    __Remaining Order__ is __Same as Input__.

== Reorder ==

    Method:
        There are 4 different reordering methods, plus the optional
        second input reference sort.


        Numeric Pattern:
            The names are sorted by a numeric pattern, as entered in the
            __Numeric Pattern__ parameter.
        Character Pattern:
            The names are sorted by a character pattern, as entered in
            the __Character Pattern__ parameter.
        Base Name Sort:
            Reorder channels by their alphabetic name first, then their
            number (ie. chan1 is ordered by "chan", then by `1`).
        Numeric Suffix Sort:
            Reorder channels by their number first, then their name (ie.
            chan1 is ordered by `1`, then by "chan").
    Numeric Pattern:
        This reorders the channels by channel number. Normally the index
        order is `0,1,2,3...` etc.. The first channel is at index `0`.
        Standard numeric patterns are allowed such as `0-6:1,2 or
        `!*:1,3`.

    Character Pattern:
        This reorders the channels by channel name. Standard character
        patterns are allowed such as `ch[XYZ]` or `chan[1-15:2,5]` or
        `chan? ch*`.

        See Channel Name Matching Options in the manual section,
        Standard Parameters of CHOPs.

    Remaining Position:
        Channels that do not match are called "remaining" and can also
        be ordered: they can be placed at the __At Beginning__ or __At
        Ending__ (in reference to the position of the matched channels),
    Remaining Order:
        The channels that did not match can have the __Same as Input__
        order, or can be sorted "AlphaNumeric"ally.
