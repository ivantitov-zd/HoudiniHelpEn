=== Bullet Data ===

Show Guide Geometry:
    Displays a visualization of the object's collision shape, including the __Collision Padding__. This is useful for debugging problems with
    collision detection, but is typically slower than just displaying the object's geometry.

Color:
    Specifies the color of the guide geometry.

Deactivated Color:
    Specifies the color of the guide geometry if the object is not moving and has been deactivated by the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

Geometry Representation:
    The shape used by the Bullet engine to represent the object. The __Show Guide Geometry__ option can be used to visualize this collision shape.

    Convex Hull:
	Default shape for the object. The [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver] will create a collision shape from the convex hull of the geometry points.

    Concave:
	The [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver] will convert the geometry to polygons and create a concave collision shape from the resulting triangles.
        This shape is useful when simulating concave objects such as a torus or a hollow tube. However, it is recommended to only use the concave
        representation when necessary, since the convex hull representation will typically provide better performance.

    Box:
	Bounding box of the object.

    Capsule:
	Bounding capsule of the object.

    Cylinder:
	Bounding cylinder of the object.

    Compound:
	Creates a complex shape consisting of Bullet primitives (including boxes, spheres, and cylinders). You will need to use the [Bake ODE SOP|Node:sop/bakeode].

    Sphere:
	Bounding sphere of the object.

    Plane:
	A static ground plane.

Create Convex Hull Per Set Of Connected Primitives:
    When __Geometry Representation__ is __Convex Hull__, the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver] will create a compound shape that contains a separate
    convex hull collision shape for each set of connected primitives in the geometry.

AutoFit Primitive Boxes, Capsules, Cylinders, Spheres, or Planes to Geometry:
    When enabled, the object's Geometry subdata will be analyzed instead of using the Position, Rotation, Box Size, Radius, and Length values.
    
    When __Geometry Representation__ is __Box__, __Capsule__, __Cylinder__, __Sphere__, or __Plane__, use the geometry bounds to create the shape.

Position:
    Position of the object shape in the Bullet world. Available when __Geometry Representation__ is __Box__, __Sphere__, __Capsule__, __Cylinder__, or __Plane__.

Rotation:
    Orientation of the object shape in the Bullet world.  Available when __Geometry Representation__ is __Box__, __Capsule__, __Cylinder__, or __Plane__.

Box Size:
    The half extents of the box shape. Available when __Geometry Representation__ is __Box__.

Radius:
    The radius of the sphere shape.  Available when __Geometry Representation__ is __Sphere__, __Capsule__, or __Cylinder__.

Length:
    The length of the capsule or cylinder in the Y direction.  Available when __Geometry Representation__ is __Capsule__ or __Cylinder__.

Collision Padding:
    A padding distance between shapes, which is used by the Bullet engine to improve the reliability and performance of the collision detection. You
    may need to scale this value depending on the scale of your scene. This padding increases the size of the collision shape, so it is recommended to enable
    __Shrink Collision Geometry__ to prevent the collision shape from growing.

    This option is not available __Plane__ geometry representations.

Shrink Collision Geometry:
    Shrinks the collision geometry to prevent the __Collision Padding__ from increasing the effective size of the object.

    This can improve the simulation's performance by preventing initially closely-packed collision shapes from interpenetrating, and also removes the gap between
    objects caused by the __Collision Padding__.

    When __Geometry Representation__ is __Box__, __Capsule__, __Cylinder__, __Compound__, or __Sphere__, the radius and/or length of each primitive will
    be reduced by __Shrink Amount__.

    When __Geometry Representation__ is __Convex Hull__, each polygon in the representation geometry will be shifted inward by __Shrink Amount__.

    This option is not available for the __Concave__ or __Plane__ geometry representations.

Shrink Amount:
    Specifies the amount of resizing done by __Shrink Collision Geometry__. By default, this value is equal to the __Collision Padding__ so that
    the resulting size of the collision shape (including the __Collision Padding__) is the same size as the object's geometry.

    This option is not available for the __Concave__ or __Plane__ geometry representations.

Add Impact Data:
    When enabled, any impacts that occur during the simulation will be recorded in the __Impacts__ or __Feedback__ data. Enabling this option may cause the
    simulation time and memory usage to increase.

Enable Sleeping:
    Disables simulation of a non-moving object until the object moves again. The linear and angular speed thresholds are used to determine whether the object is non-moving. If the __Display Geometry__ checkbox is turned off, you will see the color of the Guide Geometry change from the __Color__ to the __Deactivated Color__.

Linear Threshold:
    The sleeping threshold for the object's linear velocity. If the object's linear speed is below this threshold for a period of time, the object may be treated as non-moving.

Angular Threshold:
    The sleeping threshold for the object's angular velocity. If the object's angular speed is below this threshold for a period of time, the object may be treated as non-moving.
