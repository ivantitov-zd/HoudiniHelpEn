"""Mask or "key" an image based on its color."""

This COP is used to mask or "key" an image based on its color. The
colors keyed lie in the hue range, the saturation range and the
luminance range specified. Each rolloff region extends one of the ranges
with a soft rolloff function (linear, ease in, ease out, ease in ease
out and gaussian).

The key plane is used to determine the areas of the image to mask. The
mask is then applied to all scoped planes, including the key plane (if
it is scoped). Normally this key plane is color. The color can be picked
on the image by following the viewport prompts.

@parameters
    Hue/Saturation:
        #channels: /huesat

        The hue and saturation ranges of colors to key. The color wheel
        shows the key selection.
    Luminance:
        #channels: /lum

        Defines the luminance range of the colors to key.
    Discard Keyed Region:
        #channels: /discardkey

        If on, the keyed region is masked out (black). Otherwise the
        rest of the image is masked out.
    Hue Rolloff:
        #channels: /hrolloff

        Specifies the sharpness of the hue cutoff. This extends the hue
        range on either side by the rolloff size.
    Saturation Rolloff:
        #channels: /srolloff

        Specifies the sharpness of the saturation cutoff.
    Luminance Rolloff:
        #channels: /vrolloff

        Specifies the sharpness of the luminance cutoff.
    Rolloff Function:
        #channels: /rollfunc

        Specifies the rolloff function of the rolloff regions.
    Supersample:
        #channels: /subsample

        The number of subpixels sampled per pixel in one direction (2
        samples 4 pixels, 3 samples 9). More subsamples produce finer
        edges, at the cost of performance.
    Key Plane:
        #channels: /keyplane

        Specifies the plane to key. All scoped planes will be masked
        based on the result of the Chromakey on this plane.
    Add Alpha if Missing:
        If no alpha plane exists in the input, add it and fill it with the
        keying mask.
