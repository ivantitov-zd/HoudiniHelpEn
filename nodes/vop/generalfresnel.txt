"""Computes the Fresnel reflection/refraction contributions and vectors for objects with or without depth."""

This encapsulates the functionality of both the [Node:vop/fresnel] and [Node:vop/thinfilmfresnel] VOPs.

The amount of reflected light is output through `kr`, and the amount of transmitted light is output through `kt`. The normalized reflection and transmission vectors are output through `R` and `T`.

The global variables `N` and `I` will be used if the surface normal and incident vector inputs are not connected. If connected, the `N` and `I` vectors must be normalized.

@parameters

Fresnel Blending:
    #id: fres_enable
    When off, disabled any fresnel term computation. In that case, both `kr` and `kt` equal `1.0`.

Thin Film:
    #id: thinfilm
    Simulates an object with a thickness of `0`, where light that hits the material immediately refracts or reflects out. The transmission vector `T` will not deviate from the indicident ray `I`.

Fresnel Style:
    #id: fres_style
    Physically Based:
	Perform the physically correct fresnel computation.
    Use Connected 'fresnel':
	Use the value of the `fresnel` input as `kr` and `1.0-fresnel` as `kt`.

Inside IOR:
    #id: iorin
    The refractive index of the surface material.

Outside IOR:
    #id: iorout
    The refractive index of the material surrounding the surface, usually `1.0` for air.

@inputs

N:
    The surface normal. When not connected, the global variable `N` is used.

I:
    The incident vector. When not connected, the global variable `I` is used.
