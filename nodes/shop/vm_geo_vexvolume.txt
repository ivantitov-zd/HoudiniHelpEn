"""Render a volume from fields created by a CVEX shader."""

This procedural uses a CVEX shader to define a set of 3D fields in space
for volume rendering.  The export parameters on the CVEX shader will be
evaluated during rendering and bound to surface shader parameters of the
same name.  If you are rendering isosurfaces, you should define a "density"
export from the shader since mantra relies on this field being present for
isosurface root finding.

The following inputs parameters are available in the CVEX context used by
the VEX Volume Procedural:

P:
    Position to evaluate, in object space.
Time:
    Equivalent to the Time global variable passed to the surface shader,
    indicates the motion blur interframe time for evaluation.  Time will be
    a value between 0 and 1.

When using this procedural, you should always specify an explicit bounding
box.  If you don't specify a box, parts of your function may appear clipped
in the render.  The default rendering quality for VEX volume procedurals is
set in relation to the box size, so larger boxes will use a larger ray
march step size.  You can adjust quality from the default using
`vm_volumesteprate`.

@parameters

=== Main ===

Shader:
    Specifies the CVEX shader that will define the fields in the volume.
    
Octree Divisions:
    Specifies the number of divisions to use in constructing an
    acceleration data structure for the volume.  The default of 1 division
    will cause the renderer to generate samples within the entire bounding
    box for the volume.  Larger values will trigger a preprocessing phase
    before rendering that will evaluate the VEX function on a uniform grid
    to try to determine the important parts of the volume, so that empty
    portions of the image will render much faster.  
    
    NOTE:
        Values larger than 1 will only produce a correct result if the feature size in your
    volume is larger than the division size - otherwise the preprocessing phase will miss small details in the volume which will then fail to appear in the render, so increasing the octree divisions is not recommended.
    
=== IFD Bounds ===

Bounding Box:    
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.
       
SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
