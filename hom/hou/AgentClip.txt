@methods

::`__init__(name, filename, rig, keep_external_ref = True)`
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::HOM_AgentClip

    Creates a new agent clip by loading it from the specified `.bclip` or `.clip` file.

    The channels within the clip should be of the form `transform_name:channel_name`, where `transform_name` is a string matching the values returned by [Hom:hou.AgentRig#transformName] and `channel_name` is one of `tx`, `ty`, `tz`, `rx`, `ry`, `rz`, `sx`, `sy`, or `sz`.
    The channels starting with `t` denote translation, `r` denote rotation, and `s` denote scale.
    The resulting transforms will be treated as local transforms and can be read via [Hom:hou.AgentClip#sampleLocal] (i.e. they are relative to the corresponding parent transform in the agent's skeleton).
    Any other channels can be read via [Hom:hou.AgentClip#sample].

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the file does not exist or otherwise cannot be loaded.

    `name`:
        A name for the new clip, such as `walk`.

    `filename`:
        A path to a clip file.

    `rig`:
        The [Hom:hou.AgentRig] that the clip will be associated with.
        The rig is used, for example, when converting transforms from local space to world space.

    `keep_external_ref`:
        A `bool` indicating whether the external reference should be maintained when the agent is saved to a geometry file.
        If the reference is maintained, then the clip file needs to be available when the saved geometry is used (only the path to the clip is saved in the geometry file).
        Otherwise, a copy of the clip will be inlined when saving out the geometry so that the original clip is no longer needed.

::`__init__(name, chop, rig, frame = hou.frame())`
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::HOM_AgentClip

    Creates a new agent clip from a CHOP in the scene.

    `name`:
        A name for the new clip, such as `walk`.

    `chop`:
        A [Hom:hou.ChopNode] to load the clip from.

    `rig`:
        The [Hom:hou.AgentRig] that the clip will be associated with.
        The rig is used, for example, when converting transforms from local space to world space.

    `frame`:
        Specifies the frame to cook the CHOP node at.

::`__init__(clip, rig, name = "")`
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::HOM_AgentClip

    Creates a copy of an existing agent clip.
    The source clip may reference a different rig - in this case, identity transforms will be filled in for any new joints in the rig.

    `clip`:
        A [Hom:hou.AgentClip] to copy the clip from.

    `rig`:
        The [Hom:hou.AgentRig] that the clip will be associated with.
        The rig is used, for example, when converting transforms from local space to world space.

    `name`:
        A name for the new clip, such as `walk`. If this parameter is not specified, the source clip's name will be used.

::`channelNames(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::channelNames

    Returns the names of the channels in the clip.

::`data(self, binary, worldspace = False)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::data

    Returns the clip data in ASCII or binary.

    `binary`:
        Specifies whether the clip data should be saved in ASCII (`.clip`) or binary (`.bclip`) format.

    `worldspace`:
        Specifies whether the transform channels should be saved in local or world space.

::`length(self)` -> `float`
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::length

    Returns the length (in seconds) of the clip.

::`name(self)` -> `str`
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::name

    Returns the name of the clip.

::`sample(self, time, channel_name)` -> `float`
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::sample

    `time`:
        The time (in seconds) to evaluate the clip at.
    `channel_name`:
        Name of a channel in the clip. See [Hom:hou.AgentClip#channelNames].

    Evaluates the clip at the given time and returns the value of the specified channel.
    For sampling the clip's transforms, use [Hom:hou.AgentClip#sampleLocal] or [Hom:hou.AgentClip#sampleWorld].

::`sampleLocal(self, time, transform)` -> [Hom:hou.Matrix4]
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::sampleLocal

    `time`:
        The time (in seconds) to evaluate the clip at.
    `transform`:
        Index of a transform in the agent's rig.

    Evaluates the clip at the given time and returns the local transform.

::`sampleRate(self)` -> `float`
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::sampleRate

    Returns the sample rate of the clip.

::`sampleWorld(self, time, transform)` -> [Hom:hou.Matrix4]
    #cppname: HOM_AgentClip::sampleWorld

    `time`:
        The time (in seconds) to evaluate the clip at.
    `transform`:
        Index of a transform in the agent's rig.

    Evaluates the clip at the given time and returns the world transform.
