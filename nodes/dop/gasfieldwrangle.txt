= Gas Field Wrangle =

"""Runs CVEX on a set of fields."""

This is a very powerful, low-level node that lets experts who are
familiar with VEX tweak voxel values using code.

This node corresponds to the [Gas Field VOP DOP|Node:dop/gasfieldvop],
but uses a textual VEX snippet instead of a VOP network.

WARNING:
    This node requires that you understand the [vex language|/vex/].
    It is very easy to write incorrect code using this node.

This node runs the snippet _on every voxel in the input volume(s)_.
The snippet can edit the input geometry by changing attributes.
It can access information from other geometry using attributes and VEX functions.

* Press ((MMB)) on the node to see any error output from the snippet.

* You can use the VEX function `ch` to evaluate parameters.
  The path is relative to this node (`ch("parm")` will evaluate the parameter `parm` on this node).
  This evaluation will be done at the current time.

== Reading and modifying the voxel value == (values)

The current voxel value in a volume is available as `@<<volume_name>>`.
You can read this variable to get the current value, and assign it to change the value.
For example, to add `0.1` to the value of every voxel in the float volume `foo`:

{{{
#!vex
@foo += 0.1
}}}

If a volume does not have a name, it will automatically be bound to `@density`.

If you have multiple named volumes in the input, you can write a single snippet
that modifies the different volumes in different ways, for example:

{{{
#!vex
@foo += 0.1
@bar += 0.2
@baz += 0.3
}}}

== VEX variables ==

You can create temporary variables.
For example, the following code reads an offset location from a point.

{{{
#!vex
vector temp = @P;
temp += {0.1, 0.2, 0.3};
@density = volumesample(@OpInput1, 0, temp);
}}}

== Bound Variables ==

A number of variables are bound in the Volume VOP context. 
Use the `@` prefix syntax to access them.

`ix`, `iy`, `iz`:
	The integer index of the current voxel.  With VDBs, this can be
	negative.
`resx`, `resy`, `resz`:
	The resolution of the current volume primitive.  For VDBs this
	is the size of the active voxel region.
`dPdx`, `dPdy`, `dPdz`:
	Vectors giving the length and orientation of the x, y, and z edges of
	the 0th voxel.
`center`:
	The center of the volume in SOP space.
`SimTime`:
	Current simulation time in seconds.
`SimFrame`:
	Current simulation frame.
`Time`:
	Current playbar time in seconds.
`Frame`:
	Current playbar time in frames.
`TimeInc`:
	Time increment between frames, in seconds.
`OpInput1`, `OpInput2`, `OpInput3`, `OpInput4`:
	A string that can be used to refer to the corresponding input
	of this SOP in vex operations that take file parameters.

@parameters

== Code ==

Group:
    Only run the program on these volumes in the input geometry.
    Leave this blank to modify all volumes in the input.
    
    (See [reading and writing voxel values|#values] above.)

[Include:/nodes/sop/pointwrangle#snippet]

Fields to Write to:
    Only modify fields if their names match this pattern.
    The default pattern allows any volume to be modified.
    You can speed up the node by only listing fields that are _actually_
    modified by the snippet.
    
    For example, in the following snippet, only the `density` field is modified.
    The `temperature` field is not modified, only read.
    
    {{{
    #!vex
    @density = @temperature;
    }}}
    
    However, the node will both modify `density` and _copy_ `temperature`, which uses time and memory.
    To prevent this, you could set this parameter to `density` to prevent the node
    from copying `temperature`. This requires that you explicitly manage the list of writable fields.

Enforce Prototypes:
    Automatic binding with the `@` syntax can be convenient, but if your
    system becomes more complex there is the risk that a typo in an `@` binding
    will silently just bind a non-existent attribute.

    This option forces all `@` bindings to be explicitly declared as
    prototypes before use.

== Bindings ==

    Evaluation Node Path:
	VEX functions like `ch()` usually evaluate with respect to this node.
	Providing a path here can override where the path search starts
	from.  This is useful for embedding in a digital asset where you
	would like the top level digital asset to be the search root.

    Export Parameters:
	This pattern can be used to override
	the export option on the VEX shader to avoid writing to 
	certain volumes.  The pattern matches the VEX parameter, not
	the bound volume.  The volume will still be bound for
	reading.

== Inputs ==

Input 1, 2, 3, 4:
	These control the four virtual inputs accessible inside of VOPs.

	They can be accessed with the OpInput1-4 wires from the VOP, or with
	the `@OpInput1-4` string parameters when using VEXpressions.

	They can also be accessed numerically as 0-3 with VEX functions
	that take an input number.

	None:
	    No geometry is wired to this input.
	SOP:
	    The SOP geometry will be cooked prior to running the VEX and
	    the result wired to this input.
	DOP Data:
	    Data in the current simulation to reference.  Specified as
	    an object/data, for example, `pyro1/vel` to refer to the velocity
	    field of the `pyro1` object (which will show up as three volume
	    primitives).
	Nth Context Geometry:
	    These refer to the SOPs wired into the parent DOP Network itself.

Use Timestep:
    Whether to scale the Timescale by the current timestep.  If off,
    timescale is an absolute time in seconds.

Timescale:
    An overall scale applied to the actual timestep.
