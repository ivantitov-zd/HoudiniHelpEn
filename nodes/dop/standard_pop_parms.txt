parameters id="commonMain">>
    Activation:
        Turns this node on and off. The node is only active if this
        value is greater than 0. This is useful to control the effect of
        this node with an [expression|/expressions].
        
        NOTE:
            This is activation of the node as a whole. You can't use this parameter to deactivate the node for certain particles.

    Group:
        Only affect a group of points (created with, for example, a
        [Group POP|Node:dop/popgroup] or [Collision
        Detection POP|Node:dop/popcollisiondetect]) out of all the points in 
        the current stream.

parameters id="bindingsParms">>
    Geometry:
        The name of the simulation data to apply the POP node to.
        This commonly is Geometry, but POP Networks can be designed
        to apply to different geometry if desired.
    Evaluation Node Path:
        For nodes with local expressions, this controls where `ch()`
        style expressions in VEX are evaluated with respect to.  By
        making this `.`, you can ensure relative references work.
        It is important to promote this if you are embedding a node inside
        an HDA you are also exporting the local expressions.

parameters id="guideParms">>
    Guide:
        Controls if the guide geometry for this node should be shown. 
        
        NOTE:
                Even if it is enabled here, it can also be disabled by using the __Hidden__ flag on the DOP Node.

parameters id="geoSourceParms">>
    Geometry Source:
        Specifies the geometry to use.

        Use Parameter Values:
            Use the SOP specified in the __SOP Path__ parameter.
        Use DOP Object:
            Use the named DOP object in this DOP network.
        Use First Context Geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's first input.
        Use Second Context Geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's second input.
        Use Third Context Geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's third input.
        Use Fourth Context Geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the DOP network's fourth input.
    SOP Path:
        Path to the SOP (when __Geometry Source__ is set to __Use
        Parameter Values__).
    DOP Objects:
        Name of DOP Objects (When __Geometry Source__ is set to __Use DOP Object__).

parameters id="noiseParms">>
    Amplitude:
        Maximum value of noise field.

    Swirl Size:
        Size of the noise pattern.

    Swirl Scale:
        Spatial size of noise field in X, Y, and Z.

    Pulse Length:
        The duration of the lowest frequency in time.

    Roughness:
        Scale of noise added with each iteration.

    Attenuation:
        Noise attenuation exponent.

    Turbulence:
        Number of iterations of fractal noise to add.

parameters id="treataswindParms">>
    Treat as Wind:
        Rather than treating the computed force as an amount of force to add to
        the particle's velocity, treat it as a wind speed to be matched by the
        particle.  This causes the particle to be dragged to the goal speed,
        avoiding overshoot.

parameters id="airresistanceParms">>
    Air Resistance:
        How strong of an influence to have on the particle.  Higher values
        will cause it to match the wind velocity faster.  This is also
        used to do a weighted average when competing winds are applied
        to the same particle.

parameters id="treataswindtorqueParms">>
    Treat as Wind:
        Rather than treating the computed torque as an amount of torque to
        add to the particle's angular velocity, treat it as a wind speed to
        be matched by the particle.  This causes the particle to spin up to
        the goal speed, avoiding overshoot.

parameters id="spinresistanceParms">>
    Spin Resistance:
        How strong of an influence to have on the spin of the particle.
        Higher values will cause it to match the goal angular velocity
        faster.  This is also used to do a weighted average when competing
        winds are applied to the same particle.

parameters id="streamParms">>
    Stream Name:
        The name of the stream to be generated by this generator.
        This value is prefixed with `stream_` to form a group name
        that all particles that belong to this logical stream will
        be made part of.
