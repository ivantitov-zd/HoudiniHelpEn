== Overview ==

See the [guidelines|riggingtips]  and [rigging styles|riggingapproaches]
for general advice on bones and rigging in Houdini.

Use the [Bones|/shelf/bones] tool at the object level
to create [Bone|Node:obj/bone] objects.
Please take care not to confuse them in the following instructions
(I'll try not to either).

=== Kinematics ===

    _Kinematics_ is the life-like movement of digital characters. There are
    two main ways to specify the movement of characters:
    
    * Manually set the rotation of each joint in a bone chain.
    
    * *Inverse Kinematics (IK)* lets you specify an endpoint that a bone
      chain should reach, and then an _IK solver_ automatically finds a set
      of rotations for the joints that reach that goal. (This process is
      called "inverse" kinematics because the solver works "backward" from
      the required result to create the conditions necessary to create it).
    
      In a bone chain representing an arm for example, this lets you specify
      the position of the hand, and the solver will automatically rotate the
      shoulder and elbow joints.
    
      You can give the solver "hints" that help it create more natural
      solutions. For example, you can specify a [rest angle|restangles]
      that tells the solver the natural way a joint bends.

=== KIN_Chops === (kinchops)

    Whenever you create bones with kinematic solvers, Houdini creates a
    CHOP network called `KIN_Chops` that contains the kinematic solver
    engines for the various bone set-ups. You can create separate CHOP
    networks manually if you want, but Houdini will create `KIN_Chops`
    automatically.

    The solvers inside the CHOP network are simply CHOPs that take bones
    and goals as inputs and spit out rotations back to the bones. You
    can even choose/blend between different kinematics solvers with the
    [Composite CHOP|Node:chop/comp].

== How to draw bones ==

TIP:
    As you're drawing, use the text field in the  [operation controls
    toolbar|/basics/tools]  to name the bone.

TIP:
    Houdini uses an optimized IK solver for bone chains with two bones.
    If you have a natural two-bone part of the system, try to draw it
    separately to take advantage of the optimized solver.

:task:Draw bones with  kinematics:
    # At the object level, choose the [Bones tool|/shelf/bones].

    # Use the  [operation controls toolbar|/basics/tools]  or press
      ((RMB)) to choose a  kinematics solver
      (such as __Inverse Kinematics__).

    # Click ((LMB))to draw bones in the viewer. Click ((RMB)) to
      finish drawing.

      In the viewer, the bones are connected in a chain with a small
      sphere at the root. In the network editor, each bone has a
      node and the root and chain goals are [Null
      objects|Node:obj/null]. Houdini also creates a CHOP network
      containing the CHOPs that drive the kinematics.

:task:Draw bones without kinematics:
    # At the object level, choose the [Bones tool|/shelf/bones].

    # Click ((LMB))to draw bones in the viewer. Click ((RMB)) to
      finish drawing.

      In the viewer, the bones are connected in a chain with a small
      sphere at the root. In the network editor, each bone has a
      node and the root is a [Null object|Node:obj/null].

:task:Branch a new chain off an existing one:
    * At the object level, choose the [Bones tool|/shelf/bones].

    * To draw from the end of an existing bone, ((Shift + LMB))
      the bone.
        
    * To parent your new chain to the end of an existing bone but
      not draw from it, ((Ctrl + MMB)) the bone.


:task:Connect two existing chains with a new bone:
    # At the object level, choose the [Bones tool|/shelf/bones].

    # Shift-click the end bone of the first chain to start a new
      bone from it.

    # Press ((Ctrl + J)) to turn on snapping.

    # Click the root of the start bone of the second chain.

    #  Parent the second chain to the new bone.

:task:Split a bone into two new bones:
    # At the object level, choose the [Bones tool|/shelf/bones].

    # ((Ctrl + LMB)) the bone you want to split.

:task:Create bones in the shape of an existing curve:
    * See  [create and control bones with a curve|controlbones].

== How to edit bones ==

:task:Examine the rotations on a bone:
    * Press ((MMB)) on a bone to show its pre-transforms and the
      actual rotations if the bones are driven by an IK solver.

:task:Remove kinematics from existing bones:
    # Use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the [Bones
      tool|/shelf/bones].

    # Press ((RMB)) to show the Bones tool's tool menu and
      choose __Remove Kinematics__.

    # Select the bones you want to remove kinematics from, then
      click ((RMB)) to finish.

:task:Add kinematics to existing bones:
    # Use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the [Bones
      tool|/shelf/bones].

    # In the  [operation controls toolbar|/basics/tools] , use the
      pop-up menu to set the kind of kinematics you want to add.

    # Press ((RMB)) to show the Bones tool's tool menu and
      choose __Add Kinematics__.

    # Select the first bone of the chain and press ((RMB)), then
      select the last bone and click ((RMB)) to finish.

:task:Change the kinematics solver of existing bones:
    * Remove the existing kinematics, then add the new kinematics
      (see above).

    * If you have an existing  [kinematics solver CHOP|#kinchops]
      you want to use for a bone,
      enter its path in the bone's __Kinematic solver__ parameter
      (on the __Bones__ tab in the parameter editor).

:task:Edit bone lengths and zero positions:
    # Use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the [Bones
      tool|/shelf/bones].

    # Click the small squares at the joints between bones and use
      the translate (((T))), rotate (((R))), and scale (((E)))
      manipulators to edit them.

      You can also use the special manipulator (((Y))) to move a
      joint relative to the chain: along the upper or lower bone
      axis, or in and out along an axis halfway between the two bone
      axes.

:task:Parent bones:
    # Houdini will move the child bone to the position of the parent
      and set them up as a hierarchy in the Network pane.

      If you do _not_ want the child chain to move when it's
      parented, turn on the child object's __Keep position when
      parenting__ parameter.

      (You can turn this setting off globally in the __Objects and
      Geometry__  section of the [Houdini Preferences|/ref/windows/mainprefs]
      window.)

    # Use the [Parent tool|/shelf/parent], or
      [connect|/ref/panes/network]  the output of the parent bone to the
      input of the child.

      If the "child" chain had a null root object, it will not be
      part of the chain and you can delete it.

:task:Remove a joint:
    # Use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the [Bones
      tool|/shelf/bones].

    # Press ((RMB)) on the joint you want to remove and choose
      __Delete Joint__. Houdini merges the two bones on either side
      of the joint into one.

NOTE:
    Do not to use the transform tools to rotate joints during
    set-up because these will alter the __Rotate__ values of the bone.
    Use the Bones tool instead.
    
    Use the transform tool when you are animating the bone
    chain after setting up the rest pose.

== How to create a reverse foot setup ==

steps>>
    # Draw an IK bone chain that has a thigh bone, shin bone, ankle
      bone, and foot bone.

    # Turn on __Keep position when parenting__ on all the goal nulls.

    # [Parent|/basics/parent] the goal at the bottom of the ankle to
      the goal at the top of the ankle, and parent the toe goal to the
      ankle bottom goal.

    # [Create a new control Null|/model/nulls]  and parent the ankle top
      goal to it.

    # Turn on the control Null's __Keep position when parenting__
      parameter and parent it to the character root Null to put it in
      character space instead of world space.

    # Use the control Null to pose the foot. Translating
      and rotating the control Null drives the foot, ankle, and leg
      bones nicely.

    # Clean transforms on the toe goal and then lock
      the translate parameters and the Y and Z rotation parameters. Only
      leaving X rotations on the toe unlocked gives nice rotations with
      the reverse foot setup.

    # Repeat the previous step for the for the ankle top and ankle
      bottom goals.

    # [Change the appearance of the control null|/model/nulls]  to
      reflect its function. For example, you can position it under the
      foot bone and make it look like a footprint.

    # You can optionally make the ankle top, ankle bottom, and toe goals
      [invisible and unselectable|/nodes/obj] .
    
== How to position a Null at the end of a bone ==

Positioning a Null at the start of a bone is fairly easy: parent the
Null to the Bone object and set its position and rotation to (0, 0, 0).

To position a Null at the _end_ of a bone, do one of the following.

Snapping method:
    steps>>
        # [Turn on display of points|/basics/view] .

        # [Parent|/basics/parent] the Null to the bone.

        # Use the [Pose|/shelf/pose] or
          [Icon:TOOLS/move] Move tool and [snapping|/model/aids]
          to snap the Null to the endpoint of the bone.

Parameter reference method:
    steps>>
        # [Parent|/basics/parent]  the Null to the bone.

        # Select the Bone object and in the parameter editor press
          ((RMB)) on the __Length__ parameter and choose __Copy
          Parameter__.

        # Select the Null object and in the parameter editor press
          ((RMB)) on the __Translate Z__ parameter and choose __Paste
          Relative Reference__.

          This pastes a parameter reference to the bone's length, so the
          Null will always be offset in the bone's space by the bone's
          length. Unfortunately, the referenced length is positive, and
          we need to offset by a negative number.

        # Put a minus sign in front of the expression inserted by
          __Paste Relative Reference__ to reverse the sign (for example,
          `ch("../L_hip_bone1/length)`).
          
== Troubleshooting characters ==

IK-driven movement is jittery:
    The solver applies transformations hierarchically to
    objects. In a very large and complex rig network, errors can
    accumulate which make movement less smooth.
    
    In the kinematic solver CHOP, reduce the tracking
    threshold factor. This increases the accuracy of
    transformations but also increases 
    [cooking time|/basics/cooking].
