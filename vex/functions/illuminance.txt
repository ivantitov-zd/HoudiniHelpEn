"""Loops through all light sources in the scene, calling the light shader for each light source to set the `Cl` and `L` global variables."""

== Overview ==

    // Need to indent this so the include below doesn't go under this heading

    {{{
    #!vex
    illuminance(position, [axis], [angle], [light_typemask], [lightmask])
    {
        // Here, Cl and L will be set to the value/direction for the
        // current light source.
        // To force the shadow shader to be called, use:
        // shadow(Cl);
    }
    }}}

    The shadow shader is not called unless you explicitly call it. However, once the shadow shader has been called, the value of `Cl` will be changed for the duration of the surface shader. The shadow shader is automatically called when using any of the built-in lighting calls (e.g. [Vex:diffuse], [Vex:specular], [Vex:ambient]).

    The default value for the axis is the surface normal. The default value for the angle is PI/2. The default value for the light mask is LIGHT_DIFFUSE|LIGHT_SPECULAR (please see shading.h for the light definitions).

    The `illuminance` statement loops through all light sources for which `dot(L, axis) > cos(angle)`.

== Sending information to the light's shader ==

You can give additional pairs of string/value arguments to `illuminance` to pass named values to each light's shader. For example, to pass the value of the `N` variable as `orgN`:

{{{
#!vex
illuminance (P, nf, M_PI/2, "orgN", N) {
...
}
}}}

In the light's shader, you can receive the value from the illuminance loop with the [Vex:simport] function.

{{{
#!vex
vector orgN;
simport("orgN", orgN);
}}}

The `simport` function returns 1 if the import succeeds and 0 otherwise, so you can use it as the condition in an `if` statement.

Here's a full example:

{{{
#!vex
surface
exporter()
{
vector nf = frontface(normalize(N), I);
Cf = 0;
illuminance(P, nf, M_PI/2, "orgN", N)
{
Cf += Cl;
}

light
importer()
{
vector orgN;
if (!simport("orgN", orgN))
orgN = N;
// Use original N
Cl = orgN;
}
}}}


== Message passing ==

Within the illuminance loop, you can retrieve values from the light shader
with the the [Vex:limport] function.

The light shader can retrieve any "keyword" arguments passed to the illuminance
statement with the [Vex:simport] function.

For example, to send down the vector variable `uv` to the light shader...

{{{
#!vex
vector      uv = set(s, t, 0);
illuminance(P, dir, "uv", uv) { ... }
}}}

The light shader would be able to read this using...

{{{
#!vex
vector      uv;
if (simport("uv", uv))
printf("Imported: %g from surface\n", uv);
}}}


== lightexport keyword argument ==

You can supply the extra string argument `"lightexport"` followed by
a string argument containing the name(s) of the exported variables to
assign within the loop.

In some shaders, multiple illuminance loops are used to define different
light contributions. The `lightexport` argument is useful in these cases
to specify which variables should be exported from the different
loops.

The `lightexport` value can be a space-separated list of wildcard
patterns. For example, `illuminance(pos, dir, "lightexport", "Front*")`
exports variables whose names start with `Front`.

{{{
#!vex

surface
light_export_test(export vector diff=0;
export vector spec=0)
{
vector     nn = normalize(frontface(N, I));
vector     vv = -normalize(I);
vector     clr;

Cf = 0;
// This illuminace loop only exports to the "diff" variable
illuminance(P, nn, "lightexport", "diff")
{
clr = Cl * diffuseBRDF(normalize(L), nn);
Cf += clr;
diff = clr;
}
// This illuminace loop only exports to the "spec" variable
illuminance(P, nn, "lightexport", "spec")
{
clr = Cl * specularBRDF(normalize(L), nn, vv, 0.1);
Cf += clr;
spec = clr;
}
}}}
