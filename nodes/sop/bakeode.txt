"""Converts primitives for ODE and Bullet solvers."""

NOTE:
    This node is now deprecated. For setting up compound shapes, the __Create Convex Hull Per Set Of Connected Primitives__ option on the [Bullet Data DOP|Node:dop/bulletdata] should be  used instead.

Primitives are converted to the format required by the composite mode of the
ODE object and compound mode of the Bullet Data DOP.  For each primitive or
group of primitives that can be converted to an ODE primitive, a point with
attributes is created and added to an ODE point group.

This surface operator can give output directly to a [DOP Import SOP|Node:sop/dopimport] and take geometry input.

ODE primitives do not support all available transformations, so primitives may
be simplified in shape by this operator.  The output geometry shows
what the ODE solver assumes for its calculations.
