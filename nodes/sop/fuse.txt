"""Merges or splits (uniques) points."""

The Fuse SOP is used to snap points together, make the points unique, or snap points to a 3d grid.

You can consolidate points based on their proximity to each other (given by the distance threshold) or you can have all the points in the given group be consolidated to the first point of that group. This option is commonly used in a procedural fashion to clean up models that may have unshared edges that need to be removed. This is necessary to have certain surfaces subdivide properly. Generally the entire geometry set (empty Group field) or large parts of the geometry are procedurally processed in this method.

To consolidate all points in the group to the first point in the Group point list, turn off the distance field.

TIP:
    When fusing multiple line primitives into a single line, they will still maintain separate primitives. If you wish to make the result into a single primitive, append the [Node:sop/join] SOP with `Only Connected` enabled.

You can snap points based on their proximity to each other (given by the distance threshold) but no consolidation is done. The snap option has more options on the actual snap behavior. This method is commonly used on a small selection of points in classic modeling operations.

Snapping to a grid is useful for grabbing points and ordering them to a 3d grid. This method is commonly used on individual point selections in classic modeling operations. Snapping to a grid is also useful when outputting to low res consoles as you can truncate vertices to lie on a certain integer boundaries globally on the model.

== Using Fuse == (includeme)

# Select the points you want to merge.

# Click the [Icon:SOP/fuse][Fuse|/nodes/sop/fuse] tool on the __Polygon__ tab.

The merge is based on the proximity of the points to each other. The threshold distance for consolidation can be modified in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of points to unique or consolidate.

Update Point Normals:
    Recomputes point normals, if they exist.

Use Accurate Distance:
    #id: accurate

    Forces Distance to represent consolidate or snap distances accurately,
    and forces consolidation or snapping to be performed in order of point
    number, (reverse for snapping to highest point number), to avoid moving
    points to within Distance of other points.  That issue may
    still occur for snapping to average value, as no snap order can then
    guarantee that points aren't moved to within Distance of other points.

== Consolidate ==

Overview:
    Points within a specified distance of each other will share
    a point.

Distance:
    #id: dist

    Threshold distance for consolidation.

Remove Degenerate Primitives:
    Cleans up any degenerate polygons.

Keep Unused Points:
    Keeps any points that were not part of a primitive before
    the fuse and, if __Remove Degenerate Primitives__ is set,
    any points orphaned by removing degenerate polygons.

Keep Consolidated Points:
    Keeps any points that are orphaned and not part of any
    polygons because they have been consolidated.

Group Propagation:
    This lets you specify how the fused points get assigned to
    the Point Groups from the original points.

    Least Point Number:
        The fused point will belong to same groups that the
        original point with the least point number belongs to.
        This is the fastest method.
    Union:
        The fused point will belong to any group that contains
        at least one of the original points. For example, if two
        original points are fused and one of them belongs to
        Group A and the other belongs to Group B, the fused
        point will belong to Groups A and B. In other words, the
        fused point will belong to the union of the groups of
        the original points.
    Intersect:
        The fused point will belong to the groups that contain
        all of the original points. As an example, if two
        original points are fused and one belongs to Groups A
        and B while the other belongs to Groups B and C, the
        fused point will belong to Group B. In this case, the
        fused point will belong to the intersection of the
        groups of the original points.

== Unique ==

Makes each vertex a unique point.

== Snap ==

Overview:
    Point positions and/or point attributes only will be
    altered.

Distance/Grid:
    How to do the snapping. Internal will snap points to other
    points in the same object. Grid will snap to user specified
    grid lines.

=== Distance ===

Snap Type:
    What heuristic to use to determine the position or attribute
    values of snapped points. It can be the average of all the
    points to be snapped. Or, it can snap to the least or
    greatest point number, which is useful if you know one of
    those is the real value.

Snap Distance:
    #id: tol3d

    The maximum distance to snap points together

Snap Point Positions:
    Moves the point positions according to the __Snap Type__.
    If this is turned off, the point positions will not be
    changed. This is mainly useful if you enable __Snap Point
    Attributes__ and only want to snap together the point
    attributes.

Snap Point Attributes:
    Snaps together the point attribute values of the snapped
    points. The values are set according to the __Snap Type__,
    so the new attribute values can be an average, or taken from
    the point with the least or greatest point number.

Point Attributes:
    Select the point attributes that you want to snap together.
    If you set __Snap Type__ to "Average", you can only snap
    floating point-, vector- or integer- valued attributes.

=== Grid ===

Grid Type:
    #id: gridtype

    How to specify the grid size.

Grid Spacing:
    #id: gridspacing

    The number of units between each grid line

Grid Lines:
    #id: gridlines

    The number of grid lines every unit

Grid Power 2:
    #id: gridpow2

    The same as gridlines, but a power of two is specified. This
    means a value of 7 means 128, and 9 means 512.

Grid Offset:
    #id: gridoffset

    A number from 0 to 1 which specifies what offset the grid
    should have from (0,0,0).

Grid Rounding:
    #id: gridround

    Which way points should snap to the grid.

Grid Tolerance:
    #id: gridtol

    Maximum distance to move points to grid
