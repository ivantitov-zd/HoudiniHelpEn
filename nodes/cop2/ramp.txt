= Ramp =

"""Generates a variety of linear and radial ramps, which are fully
keyframable."""

This COP generates a variety of linear and radial ramps, which are fully
keyframable. Any number of points may be used to define the ramp.

[Include:is_a_generator]

To edit a ramp interactively:

* ((LMB)) click on the background to add a new point.

* ((LMB)) click on an existing point to edit its color with a color
  selector.

* ((LMB)) drag an existing point to move it within the ramp.

* Press ((Del)) over an existing point to delete it.

* ((Alt + LMB)) click a handle to select it.

* ((Alt + LMB)) drag around handles to select them.

* ((Alt + LMB)) click empty space to deselect handles.

@parameters

== Ramp ==

Ramp:
    The type of ramp to generate.

    Horizontal:
        Ramp is linear type with points horizontally.
    Vertical:
        Ramp is linear type with points vertically.
    Radial:
        Ramp is circular with points extending radially.
    Concentric:
        Ramp is circular with points at varying distances from
        the center.
Global Interpolation:
    The interpolation between ramp point which is used by
    default. Individual points may override this interpolation.

    Step:
        The segment is constant valued, immediately changing to
        the next color.
    Hold:
        The segment is constant valued, holding the current
        color until the next point.
    Linear:
        The segment is linearly interpolated between the two
        point colors.
    Ease In:
        The segment drops off quickly from the first value and
        eases into the second.
    Ease Out:
        The segment eases out of the first value and drops
        quickly to the second.
    Ease In Ease Out:
        The segment eases into both values.
Number of Cycles:
    #id: cycles

    The number of cycles to repeat the ramp for.
Phase:
    #id: phase

    The phase (0-1) to offset the ramp.
Rotation:
    #id: rotate

    Rotates the ramp.
Center:
    #id: centerx /centery

    Specifies the center of the ramp for radial and concentric
    ramps.
Wrap First To Last:
    If on, an implicit segment is created between the last and
    first points. Otherwise, the value of the first and last
    ramp points is held before or after the ramp point range.
Repeat Ramp:
    For a concentric ramp, this will repeat the ramp continually
    if on. Otherwise, only 1 cycle is used.

== Points ==

Point N:
    #id: p<<n>>pos

    The U coordinate of this ramp point (0-1).
Color:
    #id: p<<n>>colorr /p<<n>>colorg /p<<n>>colorb /p<<n>>colora

    The color of the ramp point. Values may be less than zero
    or greater than 1.
Segment N Interpolation:
    By default, the global interpolation is used. This can
    override the interpolation to give a segment a specific
    interpolation.
