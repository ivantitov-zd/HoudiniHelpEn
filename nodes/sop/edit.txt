== Overview ==

The Edit SOP allows you to transform or sculpt faces/edges/points on a
curve/surface interactively.

Unlike most Houdini operators, _Edit is cumulative_. You can perform
multiple edit operations (on multiple selections) in a single Edit node.
An Edit node stores the _final result_ of all the edits you perform _in
that node_.

Edit supports two main ways of working: _edit_ (using a
[manipulator|/basics/handles] ) and _sculpt_ (using [brush
tools|/basics/brush] ).

NOTE:
    *You cannot animate Edit nodes*. To animate transformations, use the
    [Point|Node:sop/point], [Transform|Node:sop/xform], [Soft
    Transform|Node:sop/softxform], [Peak|Node:sop/peak], or [Soft
    Peak|Node:sop/softpeak] operators, or other types of deformation.

<!--
Hitting "m" while in the edit SOP will switch to Sculpt mode.

Usage note for Sculpt Mode:

Holding ALT + LMB Drag over the surface of the geometry will allow you to interactively adjust the radius of the brush.

Holding CTRL + RMB will allow you to quickly change Goals for the brush between Deform, Smooth, Deform and Smooth, and Erase.

In Sculpt Mode, the brush casts through the surface and sometimes you may find that strokes on the surface deform points outside of the brush's radius; sometimes on the opposite side of the surface.

You can minimize this behaviour by enabling the Depth parameter in the Brush tab. The Depth values limit how far above and below the surface the brush will cast. Usually, copying the Radius parameter from the Brush tab and pasting it as a relative reference into both Depth parameter fields is sufficent to eliminate this behaviour, unless, of course, you are using a brush with a very large radius. Pasting the Radius as a relative reference as above will give you a perfectly spherical brush or cubic brush depending on the brush type.

== Setup ==

* You can only use Edit interactively in the viewer.

* *Keep the parameters for the Edit SOP visible* in a parameter
  editor pane as you use the tool in the viewer pane. The parameters
  contain controls that modify the behavior of the tool in the
  viewer.

  In edit mode, the parameters affect the current selection. When
  you select new points/faces, the parameters reset. In sculpt mode,
  the parameters affect future strokes.

* Before you try to select points, turn on the Points icon in the
  viewer pane's display options toolbar (on the right side of the
  viewer). (If the display options toolbar is not visible, click the
  stowbar on the right side of the viewer pane to show it.)


== Tasks ==

:task:Transform points and/or faces:
    # In the parameters, click __Edit__ and then __Transform__.

    # Set the selection type using the toolbar on the left side
      of the 3D viewer, or the __Select > Selection Type__
      submenu.

    # Select the points/faces you want to transform.

    # Do any of the following:

:task:Move points and faces along their normals:
    # In the parameters, click __Edit__ and then __Peak__.

    # Use the manipulator to move the selected items along their
      normals. See how to transform points and/or faces above
      for more information about how to interact with the Edit
      tool.

    # See also the [Extrude SOP|Node:sop/extrude].

:task:Push, pull, or smooth points by brushing over them:
    # In the parameters, click __Sculpt__.

    # The controls on the tabs control how the brush works.
      These controls are common to all brush-based tools in
      Houdini. See  [how to use brush tools|/basics/brush] .


== Notes ==

* Press ((RMB)) while working in the viewer to get a menu of
  tool options. For example, you can assign different functions to
  the mouse buttons.

* Use the soft radius options to do _proportional modification_ of
  the surrounding points as you transform.

* Edit has an optional second input for reference geometry. When the
  second input is connected, the Edit node transforms your edits
  relative to the differences between the geometry to edit and the
  reference geometry.

* You can use the  [details
  pane|/ref/panes/geosheet]  to edit the position of
  each point or vertex in a piece of geometry.

* Only committed edits are affected by reference geometry. Press the __Commit Transform/Peak Changes__ button to commit an edit. The current edit is automatically committed when starting a new edit or performing a sculpt operation. 


@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The group to apply the edits to. If this is blank, the edits
    apply to all geometry in the first input. You can  [create a
    group|/model/groups]  and use this parameter to mask the
    edits so they only apply to the points or faces in the group.

Group type:
    #id: grouptype

    The type of geometry to use in the group. If the group has only
    one type of geometry (for example, points), you can just use
    "Guess from group" and Houdini will figure out the geometry type
    from the contents of the group.


== Edit ==

=== Transform ===

See the online help for the [Transform SOP|Node:sop/xform]
for information on the parameters on this tab.

Preserve Normal Length:
    Preserve normal lengths when recomputing point normals (when __Recompute point normals__ is on).
    
Local Space:
    If this checkbox is turned on, the manipulation of selected points will take place in 
    a frame defined by the averaged normals of the selected points.

Up Vector:
    If the soft transform node is operating in local space mode, 
    then the second degree of freedom may be specified via this parameter.
    The local y-axis will be rotated to match the specified up vector as
    closely as possible.

Slide on Surface:
    Constrain edits to the existing surface, so points and edges will seem to "slide" across the existing surface when you move them.


=== Peak ===

See the online help for the [Peak SOP|Node:sop/peak] for
information on the parameters on this tab.

Distance Metric:
    #id: distmetric

    Method for measuring which points are within the soft radius.

    Edge:
        The shortest distance to a point in the group following a path along
        edges.
    Surface:
        The shortest distance to a point in the group following a path along
        the surface.
    Radius:
        The 3D distance to the closest point in the group.
    Radius with Connectivity (deprecated):
        The 3D distance to the closest point in the group, as long as there
        is a connected path contained entirely within the __Soft Radius__.
    Attribute:
        __Lead Point Attribute__ is used to determine which normal each
        point should follow if in Peak mode, and __Distance Attribute__
        determines how much each point is affected. Only points in the input
        group will be affected, even if other points have valid values in the
        attribute.

Soft radius:
    #id: rad

    Distance within which other points/faces follow the
    points/faces you edit directly.
    
Apply Rolloff:
    #id: applyrolloff

    If __Distance Metric__ is __Attribute__, apply a rolloff to the distance
    output by treating the __Distance Attribute__ as raw distances. A value
    of zero will be fully transformed, while higher values will be
    transformed less. Only points whose values are less than or equal to __Soft
    Radius__ will be affected. Otherwise the value is treated as if it has
    already been rolled off, and the transform is multiplied by the value. A
    value of one will be fully transformed while smaller values will be
    transformed less.

Distance Attribute:
    #id: distattr

    If __Distance Metric__ is __Attribute__, this specifies the point attribute
    containing the values that modify the amount each point in the group is
    transformed by. If __Apply Rolloff__ is true the values are treated as
    raw distances and will be rolled off to between zero and one, otherwise
    the transform amount is multiplied by the value.

Lead Point Attribute:
    #id: leadptattr

    If __Distance Metric__ is __Attribute__ and __Translate Along Lead Normal__
    is true, this specifies the point attribute containing the point index
    of the whose normal should be translated along. A value of -1 will cause
    the point to be translated along its own normal.
    
Soft type:
    #id: type

    The type of rolloff for soft modifications. This affects how
    much influence your direct edits have on other points/faces
    with the soft radius, based on their distance.

    Linear:
        Linear falloff: the amount of influence decreases
        linearly with distance.
    Quadratic:
        Slow falloff: direct edits affect distant points/faces
        more than with Cubic.
    Cubic:
        Quick falloff: direct edits affect distant points/faces
        less than with Quadratic.
    Metaball:
        Calculate falloff according with the metaball density
        function you specify in the __Kernel function__
        parameter.
        
Tangent angles:
    #id: begintandeg /endtandeg

    Angles of the cubic rolloff function's tangents. The first
    value applies to the tangent farthest from the source point,
    the second applies to the tangent closest to the source
    point.
    
Kernel function:
    #id: kernel

    Density function to use when __Soft type__ is __Metaball__.

Visualize Falloff:
    #channels: /visualizefalloff
    When to output the soft radius falloff as a `vis_falloff` point
    attribute.

    Never:
        Never create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute.
    Always:
        Always create and write to the `vis_falloff` attribute. 
    When Viewport Tool Is Active:
        Only create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute temporarily
        when the viewport tool for this node is active.


== Sculpt ==

See the online help for the [Sculpt SOP|Node:sop/sculpt] for
information on the brush parameters.

Use Orient Attribute:
    #id: useorient

    If set, all edits are applied relative to the orientation
    described by a quaternion point attribute named "orient". This
    is most useful when the orient attribute is animated for use
    with the Wire Solver DOP.
    
Use Mirror:
    #id: doreflect

    If set, all operations will be reflected along the plane of
    symmetry.
    
Axis:
    #id: symaxis

    This defines the normal of the plane of symmetry for
    reflection.
    
Origin:
    #id: symorig

    This defines the origin of the plane of symmetry for
    reflection.
    
Distance:
    #id: symdist

    This is the distance of the plane of symmetry from the origin of
    symmetry.
    
Threshold:
    #id: symthreshold

    This is the maximum distance from a points mirrored position to
    search for the mirrored point.

Plane Tolerance:
    #id: symplanetol

    This is the tolerance used to determine if a point lies directly on the
    plane of symmetry.  The soft falloff from any points not directly on the
    plane will be clamped at the plane of symmetry.
    
Recompute Point Normals:
    #id: updatenmls

    Recomputes point normals if they exist.
    
Commit Transform/Peak Changes:
    #id: apply

    Saves the current edit and resets the parameters to start a new
    edit.
    
Reset All Changes:
    #id: clearall

    Restores geometry to initial state.


@inputs

Geometry to edit:
    The geometry to apply the edits to.
    
Reference geometry:
    (Optional) When this input is connected, all edits take place
    relative to the difference between the geometry to edit and this
    geometry.
