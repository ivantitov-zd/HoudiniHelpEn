= Fetch =

"""Imports channels from other OPs."""

The Fetch CHOP imports channels from other OPs. It can grab either the
regular control channels from any OP, or data channels that are output
from chops. Control channels are those channels associated with
parameters of any OP. Data channels are only present in CHOPs, and are
the channels output by CHOPs.

The Fetch CHOP can get the output channels from CHOPs in other CHOP
networks.

The __Channels__ field also supports channel groups with the syntax.

@channelgroupname

NOTE:
    Fetching cannot be recursive. If a CHOP exports to an object's
    channel, and that object channel is fetched, the Fetch CHOP cannot
    feed to the CHOP that exports. This will produce an error message in
    the Fetch CHOP. If this occurs, you will have to lock the Fetch CHOP
    before exporting back to the object.


@parameters

    == Source ==

        Node:
            #channels: /obj.

            The Node and Channels determine where the channels come
            from. They are concatenated together, so a channels of "tx"
            and a path of "/obj/model" will fetch "/obj/model/tx". They
            also accept globbing, so a Node of /obj/ and a channel of
            tx would select all the tx channels from all the nodes
            inside.
        Channels:
            #channels: /obj/geo1/*.

            This field is appended to the specified Node to complete the
            path. Wildcards and multiple entries are allowed.
            t? implies all translate channels, tx, ty, tz. Alternately,
            you can set leave the node blank and specify the full path
            in Channels, such as /obj/geo/*.
        Fetch:
            If fetching from another CHOP, you can fetch its OP Control
            Channels or CHOP Data Channels. All other OPs have only
            Control Channels, so leave this menu set at "OP Control
            Channels".
        Select:
            Fetched channels can be eliminated to include only control
            channels that have been added, or further, channels that
            have been added and are animating over the start/end time
            range. Applies to OP Control Channels.

    == Channel ==

        Channel Names:
            Sets how the fetched channels are named. A : is placed in
            the channel name where / is in the path.

            Channel Name:
                Only use the name of the channel.
            OP and Channel Names:
                Include the parent OP name with the channel name,
                separated by a colon (:).
            Full Path Name:
                Use the full path as the name, with the parts separated
                by a colon (:).
        Channel Range:
            Indicates how much of the channel to fetch.

            Use Full Animation Range:
                All of the animated range.
            Use Current Frame:
                Only the sample at the current frame.
            Use Start/End:
                Specify the range below.
        Start:
            #channels: /start

            The beginning of the fetch.
        End:
            #channels: /end

            The end of the fetch.
        Sampling Method:
            Determines the sample rate to be used.

            New Rate (Same Index Range):
                Resample to new rate below.
            Resample From Maximum Rate:
                Use the highest rate found.
            Resample From Minimum Rate:
                Use the lowest rate found.
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample to use if "New Rate" is selected, or if no rates
            are found.
