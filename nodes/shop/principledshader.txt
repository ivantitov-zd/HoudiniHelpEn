= Principled Shader =

"""An artist-friendly shader that can model a large number of materials realistically."""

The goal of this shader is to produce physically plausible results while using intuitive rather than physical parameters. A large number of materials can be created with relatively few parameters. All parameters are in the zero to one range and represent plausible real-world values within that range.

Textures can be applied to all relevant parameters. Note that the texture value is always multiplied with the value of the parameter.

NOTE:
    This is a SHOP shader, which means it cannot be [layered|/shade/layering] with other shaders.

    If you need to do this, or if you need more control, you can use [Principled Shader VOP|/nodes/vop/principledshader] which this shader is based on.


@parameters

== Surface ==

Base Color:
    #id: basecolor
    The overall color of the surface. Depending on other parameters, this can have different effects.

    When __Metallic__ is `0.0`, __Base Color__ controls the color of diffuse reflections. Use __Reflect Tint__ to also tint reflections.

    When __Metallic__ is `1.0`, diffuse is faded and __Base Color__ only controls the color and intensity of reflections.

    Use __Sheen Tint__ to tint the __Sheen__ effect with the __Base Color__.


Metallic:
    #id: metallic
    Values closer to 1 give the shader a more metallic appearance.

    This is done by fading out the diffuse component and driving reflectivity by __Base Color__. This makes it easy to create the colored reflections typical of metallic materials.

Reflect:
    #id: reflect
    Controls the reflectivity of surfaces facing the viewer. This replaces the __Index of Refraction__ parameter found on other shaders to allow for more direct control over visual appearance.

    When a surface is rotated away from the viewer, more and more light is reflected regardless of this parameter's value. At 90 degrees away from the viewer, 100% of the light is reflected, as in the real world.

    TIP:
	How shiny an object appears mostly depends on it's __Roughness__ rather than it's __Reflect__ value. When you intend to vary shininess using a texture, __Roughness__ is usually the better parameter to use.

    NOTE:
	For additional artistic control, you can disable reflections completely by setting __Reflect__ exactly to `0.0`. When using a texture, this effect also occurs in completely black areas of the texture.

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_reflect.png]

    The effect of __Reflect__ on a black object in a white environment. Note how reflections at the edges are not affected unless __Reflect__ is exactly `0.0`.

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_reflect_white.png]

    NOTE:
	The effect of this parameter diminishes with increasing __Metallic__ values, since metallic reflectivity is tied to __Base Color__.

Reflect Tint:
    #id: reflecttint
    Tints reflections with the Base Color. This is not typical of non-metallic materials, but can be used for artistic purposes.

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_reflecttint.png]

    NOTE:
	The effect of this parameter diminishes with increasing __Metallic__ values, since metallic reflections are always tinted by __Base Color__.

Roughness:
    #id: rough
    Controls how dull a surface appears. A value of `0.0` results in a smooth surface with perfectly sharp reflections. A value of `1.0` produces a completely dull surface. Under the hood, this simulates microscopic bumps which become more pronounced the higher the __Roughness__, causing reflected light to be scattered more.

    The effect of __Roughness__ on a material with __Metallic__ set to `1.0`:

    The effect of __Roughness__ on a material with __Metallic__ set to `0.0`:

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_rough_dielectric.png]

Anisotropy:
    #id: aniso
    [Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#aniso]

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_aniso.png]

    [Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#aniso_notes]

Anisotropy Direction:
    #id: anisodir
    [Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#anisodir]

    This parameter has it's own __Filter Type__ parameter which appears when __Use Texture__ is enabled. This defaults to `Point (No Filter`), which usually works best. When you change this to an actual filter like `Gaussian`, artifacts may appear around the transition between areas with different direction values.

    TIP:
	The `0-1` range makes it easy to apply a texture to this value. To find the texture value needed for a certain direction:

	* Turn off __Use Texture__ under __Anisotropy Direction__.
	* Try out values on the slider and kick off test renders until you get the desired result.
	* Paint the slider value into your texture.
	* Turn __Use Texture__ back on.

	To help with this workflow, the __Anisotropy Direction__ remembers it's value whenever __Use Texture__ is toggled. It defaults to `1.0` when __Use Texture__ is enabled, meaning you get the unmodified texture data.

Subsurface:
    #id: subsurface
    Gives the appearance of subsurface scattering. This is a fast approximation and doesn't perform actual SSS.

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_subsurface.png]

    NOTE:
	The effect of this parameter diminishes with increasing __Metallic__ values.

Sheen:
    #id: sheen
    Produces extra reflections at grazing angles, which can be useful to match certain cloths and some other materials.

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_sheen.png]

    NOTE:
	The effect of this parameter diminishes with increasing __Metallic__ values.

Sheen Tint:
    #id: sheentint
    Tints reflections produces by __Sheen__ with the __Base Color__. This can help with matching certain cloth materials.

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_sheentint.png]

    NOTE:
	The effect of this parameter diminishes with increasing __Metallic__ values.

Coat:
    #id: coat
    Controls the intensity of coat reflections. The coat can have a different __Roughness__ value than the base layer, see __Coat Roughness__.

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_coat.png]

Coat Roughness:
    #id: coatrough
    Controls the roughness of __Coat__ reflections.

    [Image:/images/nodes/shop/principled_shader_coatrough.png]

Filter:
    #id: basecolor_textureFilter
    The type of texture filter to use. This is used for all __Surface__ parameters except for __Anisotropy Direction__, which has it's own __Filter__ parameter.

Filter Width:
    #id: surface_textureFilterWidth
    The width of the filter to use when sampling textures. Higher values causes the texture to be filtered/burred more.

== Emission ==

Emission Illuminates Objects:
    #id: emitillum
    Controls whether emission should illuminate other objects.

Emission Color:
    #id: emitcolor
    The color of light emitted from the surface.

Emission Intensity:
    #id: emitint
    Intensity of light emitted from the surface.
