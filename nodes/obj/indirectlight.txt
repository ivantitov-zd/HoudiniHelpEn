"""Indirect lights produce illumination that has reflected from other objects in the scene."""

The indirect light object can be used to add indirect lighting to the scene
that is not accounted for by raytracing - including indirect diffuse
lighting and caustics.  The light is designed to work with all rendering
engines.  When using PBR, the use of an indirect light will automatically
override the calculation of indirect diffuse lighting and caustics to use
the photon maps generated by the indirect light.  When using non-PBR
engines, the indirect light can add in indirect diffuse lighting that would
not ordinarily be accounted for in the render.

NOTE:
    In prior releases of Houdini (versions 9.0-10.0), photon maps were
    generated via the use of a second mantra ROP with parameters to control
    the photon map generation on the ROP itself.  This workflow is no
    longer supported in 11.0.  Instead, you should now use the __Indirect
    Light__ to manage rendering of photon maps.

NOTE:
    In Houdini 11.0.513 and later, global photon maps will additionally
    store and approximate glossy bounces (such as blurry reflections).  You
    don't need to modify the indirect light or mantra ROP parameters to
    take advantage of photon maps for glossy bounces.
    
NOTE:
        This node is not actually a light. It is a photon map generator that requires one or more lights in the scene to see results.

== Workflow for Diffuse Photon Map Rendering ==

Managing a renderer that uses photon maps can be a little more complex than
simply using PBR with extra diffuse bounces.  Here's a checklist to verify
that the photon maps are being generated accurately and that your render is
running as efficiently as possible.  These steps assume that you are using
the Physically Based Rendering __Rendering Engine__.

# Create an Indirect Light using either the __GI Light__ shelf tool or by using the tab menu to create an __Indirect Light__.
# In the __Render View__, perform an initial render.  Verify that the photon map generation progress is reported at the top of the IPR viewer before the image is rendered.
# On the Indirect Light object, change the __Light Type__ to __Direct Global Photon Map__.  This setting can be used during interactive renders to verify that the photon map has been generated correctly and is a reasonable approximation for the diffuse lighting in the scene.
# If the render appears to have large blocks of constant illumination, increase the __Photon Count__ until the quality reaches an acceptable level.
# Switch between __Direct Global Photon Map__ and __Indirect Global Photon Map__ to see the quality difference between rendering the photons directly and using them for indirect lighting.  If enough photons exist in the scene, the overall light level for each render should be roughly the same.
# If you notice some artifacts in corners, increase the __Prefilter Samples__ or try increasing the __Photon Distance Threshold__.  Increasing the number of samples may require you to go back and increase the __Photon Count__ to sharpen the photon map result.

== Mantra ROP Parameters affecting photon maps ==

Photon map generation relies on the same shading parameters that are used
when rendering with PBR.  The following ROP parameters will affect the
photon map generation.

* The limit parameters on the __Shading__ tab of the [Mantra ROP|Node:out/ifd].  For example, to see diffuse bounces in the photon map increase the __Diffuse Limit__ parameter, and to see refractive caustics increase the __Refract Limit__ parameter.
* The __Allowable Paths__ parameter on the __Shading__ sub-tab of the on the __Rendering__ tab on the [Mantra ROP|Node:out/ifd].  By default, PBR will exclude indirect lighting that it considers caustics since these types of paths commonly introduce a significant amount of noise in the render.  However, with photon maps, caustic paths are easily generated and cached as part of the global photon map solution.  To enable caustic paths in the photon map and in the render, change __Allowable Paths__ to __All Paths__.

@parameters

Light Type:
    Controls the type of indirect light to be produced and the algorithm
    used to produce it.

    Indirect Global Photon Map:   
	Produces indirect diffuse lighting using a photon map.  Rather than
	using the photon map directly, diffuse rays will be traced from the
	shading point and the photon map will be used only for these
	secondary hits.  It is necessary to increase the __Diffuse Limit__
	on the mantra ROP to at least 1 for indirect diffuse lighting to
	appear in the render.

	When using PBR, using an Indirect Light of this type is a fast
	alternative to simply increasing the __Diffuse Limit__ on the ROP.
	Photon maps can be effective in improving performance and reducing
	noise especially in indoor scenes that involve a large amount of
	diffuse inter-reflections.  To compare performance and quality with
	and without the use of the photon map, toggle the __Light Enabled__
	toggle on this light.

	NOTE:
	    This setting is analogous to the __Final Gather__ algorithm
	    available in other rendering software.
    
    Direct Global Photon Map:
	Directly display the diffuse photon map illumination on surfaces.
	This setting is useful to visualize the contents of the photon map
	but should generally not be used for renders.

    Caustic Photon Map:
	This setting should be used when rendering caustics, or patterns of
	focused light that appear when illumination reflects off a
	reflective or refractive object.  When using Caustic Photon Map
	mode, the photon map generation algorithm will also be configured
	to only calculate light paths that reflect or refract from objects
	before being absorbed by a diffuse surface.

	TIP:
	    If you're rendering a scene that requires both caustics and
	    indirect diffuse lighting, you should render with 2 indirect
	    lights - one for the indirect diffuse and another for caustics.
    
    Irradiance Only:
	Produces indirect diffuse lighting using path tracing.  This
	setting is only meaningful when rendering with non-PBR rendering
	engines, and it will use the
	[irradiance VEX function|Vex:irradiance].

Light Color:
    Allows indirect illumination to be artificially tinted when rendered.
    This parameter does not affect photon map generation.

Light Intensity:
    Allows indirect illumination to be artificially scaled when rendered.
    This parameter does not affect photon map generation.

Light Enabled:
    Turning this toggle off is equivalent to setting the light intensity to 0.

Enable Light In Viewport:
    Turning this off removes the light from consideration in the
    viewport.  This is useful for lights which only make sense at
    render time.

== Photon Map Options ==

Options to control generation and rendering of photon maps.

Auto-generate Photon Map:
    Enables automatic generation of a photon map.  Photon map generation
    will proceed before the main render begins.

    TIP:
	Use the IPR Viewer pane to see a progress bar for photon map
	generation.  When using IPR with photon maps, be sure to press the
	__Render__ button if you need to regenerate photon maps - photon
	maps are treated the same way as depth maps in IPR, and so must be
	manually regenerated when they are out of date.

Photon Count:
    The approximate number of photons to store in the photon map file.

Light Mask:
    A bundle to specify the lights to use for photon map generation from
    the indirect light.  By default, all lights will contribute to photon
    map illumination.

    It is possible to separate indirect lighting from different light
    sources by creating several Indirect Light objects with disjoint light
    masks, and then using per-light exports to create a deep raster plane
    for each Indirect Light's illumination.

    NOTE:
	Since the Indirect Light object does not produce any illumination
	of its own, all Indirect Light objects are automatically ignored
	while generating photon maps.

Photon Target:
    A bundle to specify what objects should be targeted for photon storage.
    This parameter should be used to optimize photon renders when you know
    that all photons must hit or pass through a specified object.

    TIP:
	If your render does not show any photons and produces an error
	message indicating that photon generation was aborted, you may need
	to adjust the photon target parameter to focus photon generation on
	a particular object in the scene.  This error can commonly occur
	when generating caustics from a small glass object in the presence
	of much larger objects defining its environment.

Photon File:
    The photon map file to generate on disk.  When rendering an animation,
    you should usually modify this value to include the frame number.

Photon Filter:
    Photon filter to use.  The default __Convex Hull__ filter improves photon
    map quality in corners of the scene.  You can improve render time
    slightly by switching to __Sphere__ at the expense of accuracy.

Filter Samples:
    When reading from the photon map, this is the number of photons to
    filter.  When rendering with a prefiltered photon map, you should use a
    small number (generally from 1-10).  When rendering non-prefiltered
    photon maps, you should use a large number (generally 50-500).

Photon Map Stores Direct Lighting:
    Store direct lighting in the photon map.  When disabled, the photon map
    will only store indirect lighting - meaning that a full direct lighting
    computation is required in addition to a photon map lookup to compute
    lighting at a hit surface.  In either case, the render should account
    for the same light paths.  Normally you should leave this parameter
    unchanged.

    When rendering caustic photon maps, this parameter is ignored.

Prefilter Photon Map:
    After photon map generation but before rendering, prefilter the photon
    map so that much fewer photon samples are required for rendering.
    Prefiltering can often take as long as the photon map generation
    process itself.

Prefilter Samples:
    The number of photons to filter during prefiltering.  This should
    normally be a large value (generally 50-500).

Prefilter Ratio:
    The ratio of photons to store in the prefiltered photon map to photons
    in the original non-prefiltered map.  Prefiltering can often take
    several minutes for large photon maps.  Using a ratio less than 1 can
    improve performance by only filtering the specified proportion of
    photons in the map while introducing only a small difference in render
    quality.

Enable Point Cloud:
    Use the photon map for direct lighting as if it were a geometry area
    light with point cloud generation enabled.  This setting can help to
    reduce noise in renders using photon maps where the illumination is
    highly variable.

    Note that after toggling this setting it's necessary to regenerate
    photon maps since the content of the map will changes depending on this
    setting.  Only prefiltered maps are supported.

    NOTE:
	This setting is currently experimental.  In particular, it has the
	following limitations:
	* It requires a prefiltered photon map
	* It does not work correctly with volumes
	* Other indirect illumination will be completely disabled
	* The photon distance threshold does not have any effect (it's assumed to be 0)

== Indirect Diffuse Options ==

These sampling options apply when using the __Irradiance Only__ or __Indirect Global Photon Map__ mode with a non-PBR rendering engine.  When rendering with PBR, you should instead use the sampling controls on the ROP to adjust the sampling quality for indirect diffuse lighting (such as the __Pixel Samples__ or __Min Ray Samples__).

Sampling Quality:
    The number of rays to send out for irradiance.  Ignored by PBR - use
    the __Ray Samples__ or __Pixel Samples__ to adjust quality in PBR.

Max Ray Distance:
    Maximum distance from the sample point to consider geometry for
    irradiance.  Ignored by PBR.

Sampling Angle:
    Half-angle over which to send rays for irradiance.  Ignored by PBR.

Photon Distance Threshold:
    This parameter is a quality/performance control that can be used when
    rendering global photon maps.  When too few photons are present in a
    photon map, the distance between photons can be significantly larger
    than the distance that an indirect lighting ray travels - which would
    lead to artifacts in the render if the photon map were used to
    approximate illumination.  This parameter indicates that when the
    indirect lighting ray travels a shorter distance than the distance
    between photons in the map, that the illumination should be computed
    directly (via path tracing) rather than using the photon map.

    Larger values will favor more path tracing while smaller values will
    favor the use of the photon map.  A value of 0 indicates that the
    photon map should always be used - potentially leading to artifacts in
    corners.  Generally a value between 0 and 4 is reasonable, with a value
    of 4 eliminating the vast majority of artifacts in corners.

    TIP:
	If your photon map contains very smooth illumination (for example,
	when using many filter samples), you can improve performance by
	decreasing this parameter to 0.  If you photon map is poorly
	filtered, you can improve quality by increasing this parameter to a
	value larger than 1.

    TIP:
	To visualize how much the photon map is contributing to the image relative to path tracing:
	# Configure your rendering engine to __Physically Based Rendering__.
	# Add an `indirect_diffuse` deep raster and enable __Export variable for each light__.
	# Look at the deep raster plane for the indirect light and for your other lights.  You should see that in corners of your geometry, the `indirect_diffuse` will have a larger contribution than other lights.  As you decrease the photon distance threshold to 0, the contents of `indirect_diffuse` for lights other than the indirect light should drop to 0.

Adaptive Sampling:
    Turns on an automatic optimization that will reduce the number of
    samples when there is little variation in occlusion above the
    sample point. This can improve performance at the expense of some
    possible flickering or additional noise.  Adaptive sampling will
    only take effect with more than 64 samples.  Ignored by PBR - use
    variance antialiasing instead.
