@methods

::`planes(self)` -> `tuple of strings`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::planes
    Returns a tuple of plane names in the node's image sequence.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.

::`components(self, plane)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::components
    Returns a tuple of component names for the specified plane in
    the node's image sequence.  The value of the `plane` argument must
    be a plane name.

    Raises ValueError if `plane` is None or empty.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the given plane does not exist.

::`xRes(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::xRes
    #replaces: Cmd:res
    Returns the x-resolution of the node's image for the current frame.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.

::`yRes(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::yRes
    #replaces: Cmd:res
    Returns the y-resolution of the node's image for the current frame.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.

::`imageBounds(self, plane="C")` -> `tuple` of `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::imageBounds
    #replaces: Exp: imgbounds
    Returns the x and y boundaries of the given plane in the form
    of (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax).  The value of the `plane` argument
    is the plane name.  By default, the image bounds of the color plane
    is returned.

    Note that the image bounds is not the same as the image resolution.
    For example, the image bounds for a Font COP is the bounding rectangle
    around the displayed letters while the resolution is the size of the
    node's image.

    Note that the returned image bounds is for the current frame.

    Raises ValueError if `plane` is None or empty.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the given plane does not exist.

::`depth(self, plane)` -> [Hom:hou.imageDepth] enum value:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::depth
    Return the data format used to represent one component of one pixel in
    the given image plane.

    For example, if the depth of the `"C"` (color) plane is
    [hou.imageDepth.Int8|Hom:hou.imageDepth], each of the red, green, and blue
    components is stored as an (unsigned) 8-bit integer, occupying one byte.
    If, for example, it is instead [hou.imageDepth.Float32|Hom:hou.imageDepth],
    each of the red, green, and blue components is a 32-bit float and
    occupies 4 bytes (12 bytes total for all 3 components combined).

::`maskInputIndex(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::maskInputIndex
    Return the input index of the mask input for this node. Return -1 if this
    node type does not provide a mask input.

::`allPixels(self, plane="C", component=None, interleaved=True, time=-1.0)` -> `tuple` of `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::allPixels
    Return a tuple of floats containing all pixel values for a particular image
    plane.  The pixels in the bottom scanline of the image are first in the
    result, followed by the second-last scanline, etc.  Floating point values
    in the color plane ("C"), for example, are typically in the range 0.0 to
    1.0.

    plane:
	The name of the image plane to return.  All images have "C" (color)
	and "A" (alpha) planes.  Deep raster images may contain other planes,
	such as "Pz" (depth), "N" (normal), etc.
    component:
	A particular subcomponent of the plane.  For example, for the "C" plane
	you could specify one of the "r", "g", or "b" subcomponents.  Specify
	`None` to indicate all components.
    interleaved:
	Whether the different components of the plane are interleaved in the
	result.  For example, if the plane is "C", the interleaved result would
	be organized as `rgbrgbrgb...` while the uninterleaved result would
	be `rrr...ggg...bbb...`.  This parameter has no effect when a
	particular component is specified.
    time:
	The time at which to cook the COP node.  If this value is negative,
	Houdini uses the current time.

	Note that this argument does not apply if `allPixels` is called from a
	Python COP that is cooking.  In that case `allPixels` evaluates at the
	current cooking time.

    This method does not accept a `depth` parameter like `allPixelsAsString`
    does.  The values are converted to floating point data, regardless of
    the actual depth of the image plane.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the `time` argument is set to a value
    greater than or equal to 0.0 and `allPixels` is called from a cooking
    Python COP.

::`allPixelsAsString(self, plane="C", component=None, interleaved=True, time=-1.0, depth=None)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::allPixelsAsString
    Return a binary string representation of the floats containing all the
    values of all voxels.  This method is faster than
    [Hom:hou.CopNode#allPixels], and you can use the `array` module to convert
    the string into a Python sequence.  Note that this method returns binary
    float data, so there are 4 bytes per R, G, and B component, not 1 byte.

    If depth is [hou.imageDepth.Float32|Hom:hou.imageDepth], this method
    provides a faster implementation of the following:
    {{{
    #!python
    import array
    def allPixelsAsString(self):
	return array.array("f", self.allPixels()).tostring()
    }}}

    If `depth` is `None` and this method is called from the code implementing a
    Python COP to get an input plane, the depth will be the same as the plane's
    native depth.  If `depth` is `None` and this method is called from outside
    a Python COP, the depth will be `hou.imageDepth.Float32`.  Otherwise, if
    `depth` is a [Hom:hou.imageDepth] enumerated value the result will be
    converted to the specified depth.

    See [Hom:hou.CopNode#allPixels] for more information.  See also
    [Hom:hou.Volume#setVoxelSliceFromString].

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the `time` argument is set to a value
    greater than or equal to 0.0 and `allPixelsAsString` is called from a
    cooking Python COP.

::`setPixelsOfCookingPlane(self, values, component=None, interleaved=True, flip_vertically=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::setPixelsOfCookingPlane
    Set the pixels of the plane being cooked by the currently-running
    Python COP.

    values:
	A sequence of floats, organized with the contents of the bottom
	scanline first.

	If `component` is `None`, the length of the sequence of floats must be
	the number of pixels in the image times the number of components.
	Otherwise, it must be the number of pixels in the image.
    component:
	Either the name of one component in the plane being cooked, or
	`None`.  If a component name is given, `values` will contain only
	the values for that component.  Otherwise, it will contain the
	values for all components of all pixels in the plane.
    interleaved:
	If `component` is `None` and interleaved is `True`, `values` is
	contains the first component of the first pixel, followed by the second
	component of the first pixel, until the last component of the first
	pixel, then the first component of the second pixel, etc.  If it is
	`False`, `values` contains all the values of the first component for
	all pixels, followed by all the values of the second component, etc.

	For example, if the plane is "C" and interleaved is `True`, the
	values will be organized as `rgbrgbrgb...`.  If it is not interleaved,
	it will be organized as `rrr...ggg...bbb...`.

	If `component` is not `None`, this parameter is ignored.
    flip_vertically:
	The default value for this parameter is `False`, so the first scanline
	in the `values` array is assumed to be the bottom scanline.  If
	`flip_vertically` is `True`, the input values are assumed to oriented
	starting at the top scanline.

    If you call this method from outside the `cook` function in a Python
    COP, raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed].

    See also [Hom:hou.CopNode#allPixels] and
    [Hom:hou.CopNode#setPixelsOfCookingPlaneFromString].  Also see the
    [HOM cookbook|/hom/cb] and the [Python COP|/hom/pythoncop]
    documentation for examples.

::`setPixelsOfCookingPlaneFromString(self, values, component=None, interleaved=True, depth=None, flip_vertically=False)`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::setPixelsOfCookingPlaneFromString
    Set the pixels of the plane being cooked by the currently-running Python
    COP.  This method is like [Hom:hou.CopNode#setPixelsOfCookingPlane] except
    `values` contains a binary string representation of the data instead of a
    sequence of floats.  Consequently, this method is faster.

    The `depth` parameter specifies how to interpret the values in the binary
    string, and is a [Hom:hou.imageDepth] enumerated value.  If `depth` is None,
    the depth is assumed to be in the depth of the plane being cooked.  Note
    that, by specifying `depth` explicitly, you can provide data in any depth,
    regardless of the actual depth stored by the COP.

    Note that this method can accept more types that just a string: it can
    receive any Python object that supports the buffer interface.  In
    particular, arrays from the `array` and `numpy` Python modules are
    supported, so there is no need to first construct strings from those
    arrays.

    See [Hom:hou.CopNode#setPixelsOfCookingPlane] and
    [Hom:hou.CopNode#allPixelsAsString] for more information.

::`saveImage(self, file_name, frame_range=())`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::saveImage
    #replaces: Cmd:opsave
    Saves the node's cooked image sequence to disk.  For multiple images,
    make sure that the `file_name` argument contains $F so that the
    sequence is written to multiple files.

    The optional `frame_range` argument can be specified to write
    only a subset of frames in the image sequence.  `frame_range` must
    be a 2-tuple or a 3-tuple, where the first element is the start frame,
    the second element is the end frame and the third element is the
    frame increment.  If `frame_range` is not given, then every frame in 
    the image sequence is saved to disk.

    Raises ValueError if the frame increment in `frame_range` is 0.
    Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidSize] if the size of `frame_range` is not
    0, 2 or 3.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the image could not be saved to disk.

::`getPixelByUV(self, plane, u, v, component=None, interpolate=True)` -> `tuple` of `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::getPixelByUV
    #replaces: Exp:pic, Exp:picni
    Returns plane values for a single pixel in the node's image.  The
    plane is defined by the `plane` argument which must be set to the
    plane's name.  The pixel is defined by (`u`, `v`) coordinates where 
    `u` and `v` are values between 0.0 and 1.0.  If the optional 
    `component` argument is specified, then the value for that particular 
    component is returned.  Otherwise, all of the plane's component 
    values are returned.  The value of `component` should be the
    component's name (i.e. "r", "g", "b", etc.).

    If the (`u`, `v`) coordinates do not fall exactly on a pixel, then
    the return values are calculated by linear blending of the values
    for the surrounding pixels.  This can be disabled by setting the
    `interpolate` argument to False, in which case the values of the 
    pixel located immediately to the bottom-left of (`u`, `v`) are returned.

    Note that the returned values are for the node's image at the
    current frame.

    Raises ValueError if either `u` or `v` is outside of the 0.0-1.0 range.
    Raises ValueError if `plane` is None or empty.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the given plane does not exist.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the given component does not exist
    in the plane.

::`getPixelHSVByUV(self, u, v, interpolate=True)` -> `tuple` of `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::getPixelHSVByUV
    #replaces: Exp:pic, Exp:picni
    Returns a 3-tuple containing the hue, saturation and value for
    a single pixel in the node's image.  The pixel is defined by 
    (`u`, `v`) coordinates where `u` and `v` are values between 0.0 and 1.0.  

    If the (`u`, `v`) coordinates do not fall exactly on a pixel, then
    the return values are calculated by linear blending of the values
    for the surrounding pixels.  This can be disabled by setting the
    `interpolate` argument to False, in which case the values of the 
    pixel located immediately to the bottom-left of (`u`, `v`) are returned.

    Note that the returned hue, saturation and value are for the
    node's image at the current frame.

    Raises ValueError if either `u` or `v` is outside of the 0.0-1.0 range.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.

::`getPixelLuminanceByUV(self, u, v, interpolate=True)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::getPixelLuminanceByUV
    #replaces: Exp:pic, Exp:picni
    Returns the luminance value for a single pixel in the node's image.
    The pixel is defined by (`u`, `v`) coordinates where `u` and `v` 
    are values between 0.0 and 1.0.  

    If the (`u`, `v`) coordinates do not fall exactly on a pixel, then
    the luminance is calculated by linear blending of the luminance values
    for the surrounding pixels.  This can be disabled by setting the
    `interpolate` argument to False, in which case the luminance of the 
    pixel located immediately to the bottom-left of (`u`, `v`) is returned.

    Note that the returned luminance value is for the node's image 
    at the current frame.

    Raises ValueError if either `u` or `v` is outside of the 0.0-1.0 range.
    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the node could not be cooked or
    opened for processing.

::`isSingleImage(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_CopNode::isSingleImage
    #replaces: Exp:seqanim
