= Set Length =

"""Lengthens or shortens guide hairs."""

This tool lets you lengthen or shorten curves. This can set an absolute length, scale (multiply) the existing length, or add and subtract length. 

NOTE:
    Setting __Length__ to 0 will remove hair completely.

Clicking [Icon:FUR/paint_length] __Set Length__ on the __Guide Process__ tab will put down a [Guide Process SOP|Node:sop/guideprocess] with the __Operation__ parameter set to __Set Length__.  For more information, see the [Guide Process SOP|Node:sop/guideprocess] help page.
