"""The MIDI In CHOP reads Note events, Controller events, Program Change
events, and Timing events from both midi devices and files."""

The MIDI In CHOP receives midi events from midi devices connected to the
serial port, reads midi events internal to the workstation (i.e. the
built-in software synth), and interprets musical scores in midi files.
midi data can be recorded in real time or recorded to the Houdini
timeline play bar's time. Supported midi events are:

* Note On, Note Off

* Polyphonic Aftertouch

* Channel Pressure

* Program Change

* Control Change (midi controller devices)

* Pitch Wheel

* Timer Events including beat pulses

* Bar Messages

* Start, Stop, Continue

* Song Position Pointer

* System Exclusive Messages

midi events arriving on separate midi channels may be recorded on
separate CHOP channels. Also, any number of midi CHOP can read from the
same or different sources. When Houdini receives a midi Start, Stop or
Continue event, it affects the Playbar.

NOTE:
    The values of the midi inputs are saved into the Houdini .hip file,
    and are restored when the file is reloaded. The physical controllers
    may be in a different position when the .hip is restarted, causing
    the values to jump when the controllers are moved. This is
    unavoidable.


@parameters

    == Source ==

        MIDI Source:
            MIDI Interface to listen to: hardware port, internal, file.
        MIDI File:
            The name of the MIDI file to read, if reading a file.
        Read Entire MIDI File:
            Read the whole file versus using the __Start/End__.
        MIDI Channels:
            The MIDI channel(s) to read from (1-16). The input streams
            from multiple channels will be combined into one if no
            Channel Prefix is given.
        Channel Prefix:
            When acquiring multiple MIDI channels, the channels can be
            merged or kept separate. If this field is not blank (try
            "ch"), one set of CHOP channels is made per MIDI channel:
            all CHOP channels will be prefixed with this string and MIDI
            channel number.
        Echo Messages to Textport:
            Logs all input MIDI messages to the textport.

    == Record ==

        Record Method:
            Selects one of four record methods:

            Single Frame:
                Only the most recent value is output at frame `0`.
            Current Frame:
                Like Single Frame, at the current frame.
            Current Time Slice:
                MIDI output for the current time slice.
            Full Length:
                MIDI output for the whole range.
        Record:
            A button used to manually start and stop recording.
        Reset:
            Resets the CHOP output channels to be `1` sample long.

    == Note ==

        Note Name:
            To read note events put a channel base name. (try `n`)
        Note Scope:
            The notes to record. Ranges (try `41-60`) can be used.
        Note Output:
            Notes can be recorded into one channel or each note number
            can have their own channel (Single Channels).
        Velocity:
            The velocity can be recorded as part of the note (Note
            Amplitude), as a different channel (Separate Channels), or
            not at all (Off).
        Velocity Name:
            The base name of velocity-only channels. (try `v`)
        Aftertouch Name:
            The base name of the polyphonic aftertouch channels.
        Pressure Name:
            The name of the channel pressure channel(s).
        Normalize:
            Note velocity, pressure & aftertouch can be normalized.
        Pitch Wheel Name:
            The name of the pitch wheel channel.

    == Control ==

        Controller Name:
            To read controller events, put a base name. (try `c`)
        Controller Type:
            There are 128 controllers available. You can specify
            controllers by index or choose one from the list.
        Controller Index:
            The index range of the controllers. (try `1-8`)
        Controller Format:
            Selects either 7 (most common) or 14 bit controllers.
        Normalize:
            Controller values can be normalized to simple ranges.
        Unwrap:
            Allows cyclic controllers to extend beyond MIDI limits.
        Program Change:
            The name of the program change channels(s).

    == Sys ==

        Timer Pulse Name:
            The name of a channel that pulses on MIDI beats.
        Timer Ramp Name:
            Name of channel that ramps `0` to `1` between MIDI beats.
        Timer Period/Start:
            Name of channels with start/period values of beats.
        Ticks per Beat:
            The number of timer pulses per MIDI beat.
        Bar Ramp Name:
            Name of channel that ramps `0` to `1` between MIDI bars.
        Bar Period/Start:
            Name of channels with start/period values of the bar.
        Bar Message:
            Series of hexadecimal bytes describing the Bar message.
        Song Pos Name:
            The name of the song position pointer channel.
        Channel Name 1-12:
            Output channel name for each System Exclusive message
        Message 1-12:
            Series of hexadecimal bytes describing SysEx message. (* =
            dont care, V = value 0-127, v = value 0-1 range)
