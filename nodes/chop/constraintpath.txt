"""Position an object on a path and orient it to the path's direction."""

The Constraint Path CHOP computes a position on a path using a distance on the path or a parameteric coordinate.
It can also optionally compute a rotation to make the object look at the direction of the path.
The up vector for the lookat can be given as a vector point attribute on the path, as a up vector parameter or as channel in input2.

@parameters

== Constraint Path ==

SOP Path:

    The path geometry to follow. Works with Bezier and Nurbs curves. It also works with Polygon curves but will result in jumpy direction vectors if the __Along Path__ mode is used. It doesn't support Subdivided Polygons yet.

Parametrization:

    How to map the __Position__ value on the path.

    Normalized Distance:
        A value ranging from 0 to 1 where 0.5 is the middle based on the curve length.

    Normalized Knots:
        A value ranging from 0 to 1 that depends on the number of knots on the curve.

    Distance from Start:
        A world unit distance on the path computed from the start of the path.

    Distance from End:
        A world unit distance on the path computed from the end of the path.

Position:

    Where to sample the path. See __Parametrization__.

Look At Mode:

    Define how to compute the Look At direction vector.

    None:
        The constraint won't change the previous rotation.

    Along Path:
        Use the path tangent for the Look At vector.

    Direction Attribute from Path:
        Use a vector attribute value on the current position for the Look At vector.

Look Up Mode:

    Define how to compute the Up vector.

    Up Vector:
        Use the __Up Vector__ parameter value.

    Up Vector Attribute from Path:
        Use a vector attribute value on the current position for the Up vector.

    Along Path:
        Use the path tangent for the Up vector.

Look At Axis:

    Define which of the 6 axis (X-,Y-,Z-,X+,Y+,Z+) is oriented along the Look At direction.

Look Up Axis:

    Define which of the 4 allowed axis act as the up direction.
    The allowed axis change based on the Look At Axis.
    You can't use the same axis to define the look at and up directions.

Direction Attribute:

    The attribute name representing the Direction vector on the Path Geometry.

Up Attribute:

    The attribute name representing the Up vector on the Path Geometry.

Roll:

    Roll angle in degrees around the Lookat At Axis.
