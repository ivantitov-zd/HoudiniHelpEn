"""How to set up agents to adapt their animation to terrain and prevent skating."""

== Overview ==

*Terrain adaption* adapts the animated foot placement of agents to the terrain they're moving over. *Foot locking* ensures agent feet stay planted in the same place while on the ground, preventing "skating".

Houdini uses two extra channels alongside an agent's animation channels to indicate when a foot is "on the ground" in the animation cycle. (A value of `1` in the channel means the foot is planted. Values from `0` to `1` blend between planted and the original animation.) The solver locks the ankles and toes in place on the terrain for the duration of the foot plant.

Houdini can automatically generate these channels for you based on when the ankle joints are at their lowest points in the animation cycle.

== Set up ==

How you associate the "foot planted" channels with the agent is different depending on how you are generating the agent:

* If you get the agent from an FBX file, or from a character in the scene, use the controls on the [Agent Prep SOP|Node:sop/agentprep]'s __Additional channels__ tab.

    * Specify your agent's channel names for each ankle/toe on the [Agent Prep SOP|Node:sop/agentprep].

    * Click __Create Foot Plant CHOP Network__ to automatically generate the foot-plant channels for the agent's animation.

* If you are [baking the agent to disk|baking], the __Bake Agent__ shelf tool sets up the CHOP for you after asking you to select ankle and toe joints from the rig.

    You can use the controls on the [Agent ROP|Node;out/agent]'s __Additional channels__ tab to change the settings.

Both methods automatically create a [Foot Plant CHOP|Node:chop/footplant] in a CHOP network to generate the foot plant channels from the character's animation. However, you could manually create the channels or generate using your own CHOPs and specify the channels in the settings instead.

When terrain adaptation is on in the crowd solver and the __Enable Foot Locking__ parameter is enabled, the solver will automatically use the foot planting channels.

== Tips and notes ==

* For advanced users, the [Hom:hou.AgentClip] HOM class has methods for querying and sampling non-transform channels in a clip, or you can use the [Vex:agentclipsample] VEX function to sample in VEX.

* The foot planting functionality is implemented in the lower-level [Agent Terrain Adapation DOP|Node:dop/agentterrainadaptation] inside the solver. This node may be useful if you implement your own low-level crowd solution.

* The [Agent Clip SOP|Node:sop/agentclip] is the low-level node that adds channels to an agent. This node may be useful if you are implement your own low-level crowd solution.
