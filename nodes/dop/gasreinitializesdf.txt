"""A microsolver that reinitializes a signed distance field while preserving the zero isocontour. """

The Gas Reinitialize SDF DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Reinitialize SDF DOP is used to ensure signed distance fields
remain signed distance fields. Under various operations, such as
advection, the signed distance field may become distorted and no longer
represent actual distances to the surface. This DOP restores the
distance-to-surface property of the SDF while preserving the zero
isocontour that represents the surface.


@parameters
    Field:
        The field to be restored into an SDF.
    Rebuild SDF:
        The voxels that border the zero isocontour are used to
        determine the initial zero isocontour. The rest of the field is
        then rebuilt from these values directly.
    Apply Sign Fix:
        If the field does not have the correct signs associated with
        inside/outside, this option will enable a sign fixing operation
        during the __Rebuild SDF__ stage.
    Reinitialize SDF:
        If the field is already almost a signed distance field, a less
        drastic error correction can be performed. 

	    The reinitialization equation is applied which will converge on a signed distance
        field without affecting the boundary.
    Reinitialize Iterations:
        The number of times to apply the reinitialization equation.
    Integration Method:
        The method of integration for applying the reinitialization equation.
        __Midpoint__ is more accurate than __Euler__, but also more expensive.
    Use Bandwidth:
        Assume that beyond the supplied __Bandwidth__, the SDF is already
        valid and does not need reinitialization. This option works for both
        __Rebuild SDF__ and __Reinitialize SDF__ operations.
    Bandwidth:
        Beyond this number of voxels, the SDF is assumed to be valid and does not
        need reinitialization.
