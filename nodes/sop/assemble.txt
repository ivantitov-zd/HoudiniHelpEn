"""Cleans up a series of break operations and creates the resulting pieces."""

This operator is used to finish the process of breaking a piece of geometry. It uses the groups and connected pieces created by the [Break|Node:sop/break] operator to output a set of disconnected pieces.

NOTE:
    If your broken object is made into a dynamic object, you do not need to append an assemble because one will be added automatically.
    
The assemble node cleans up the geometry. The following screen captures show what the geometry looks like before using the assemble tool, and after.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The group that will be finalized.  Ideally this should encompass 
    all geometry that has been affected by a [Break|Node:sop/break] operator.
Inside Group:
    #id: inside_group

    The group name corresponding to the inside faces created by the 
    preceding break operators.  This name should remain consistent 
    for all breaks affecting the same geometry.

Output Prefix:
    #id: outside_group

    The prefix applied to the name attribute and names of the groups
    created by the operator. 
    
    For example, an object broken into 3 parts and given an Output 
    Prefix of `piece` will have three groups named `piece0`, `piece1` 
    and `piece2`.

Piece Attribute:
    An integer primitive attribute with the piece number will be created
    storing which piece the primitive belongs to.

Create Groups:
    Create a new group for each piece.

Create Name Attribute:
    Create a primitive attribute called "name" identifying primitives
    belonging to each piece.

Connect Inside Edges:
    #id: connect

    Whether the inside faces of the broken geometry will be connected 
    to the outside faces.  When enabled, the geometry of each output 
    piece will be fully connected.

    TIP:
        Disabling this option can help create the illusion that 
        the geometry is not actually broken, since the outside surface 
        of the object remains unchanged.

Cusp Edges:
    #id: doCusp

    Whether the edges of the output geometry will be cusped.  Ideally, 
    enabling this option will cusp the edges between the outside 
    and inside faces of the broken object.  
    
    However, here the cusp will be applied to all acute angles in 
    the geometry, not just the intersections between the cutting 
    surfaces and the object.

    TIP:
        This is another option designed to hide the appearance of 
        fracture lines in the broken object.  

        However, __Cusp Edges__ should 
        only be used for smooth geometry with no acute angles, or for 
        objects that are going to be cusped anyway.

Create Packed Geometry:
    If the output geometry contains a primitive attribute called "name", a
    packed fragment will be created for each unique value of the name
    attribute. Additionally, a point attribute called "name" will be
    created to identify the piece that packed fragment contains.

    Otherwise, the output geometry will be packed into an embedded packed
    primitive, and the __Output Prefix__ will be used to create the "name"
    point attribute.

[Include:/nodes/sop/pack#transfer_groups]

Pivot Location:
    Specifies how to initialize the offset for the point referenced by the
    packed primitive.
