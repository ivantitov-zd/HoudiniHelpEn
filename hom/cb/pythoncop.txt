= HOM cookbook |> Python COP =

== Overview ==

You can create compositing node (COP) assets that are [defined by a Python script|../pythoncop] instead of a subnetwork of nodes (__File > New operator type__, click __Python type__, set __Network type__ to "Compositing"). This example defines a Python SOP that copies its input, creates a Cd (diffuse color) point attribute, and assigns each point a color based on the distance to a position.

NOTE:
	This example requires the [numpy|http://numpy.sourceforge.net] library.

Open `$HFS/houdini/help/files/hom_cookbook/multi_stamp.hip` to see the node.

== Implementation ==

* You can load the pre-made asset from `$HFS/houdini/help/files/hom_cookbook/PythonCops.hda`

* Right-click a `multistamp` node and choose __Type properties__ to open the asset's [type properties window|/ref/windows/optype].

* We created parameters in the __Parameters__ tab, just as we would for a normal asset.

* The __Code__ tab contains the Python code implementing the node's logic.
